        <li><i>First Glances</i></li>
        <li>Physical Appearance: A tall man, unblemished skin, black hair, the recognisable knife-like ears of elves, however they are shorter in appearance, despite his rather uncommon appearance he does indeed appear to have most of the distinguishing characteristics of an kaldorei elven male. <b>(Set to Hidden)</b></li>
        <li>Attire: Rarely ever seen in casual clothing, he'd always be seen in some sort of armour, be it light or heavy, this does not seem to change no matter if he's in a city or in the wilderness.</li>
        <li>Injuries: -</li>
        <li>Aura: While most beings both of a magical affinity, and not, radiate an aura, this man would not, in fact he would radiate nothing, appearing as more of a void in a surrounding space compared to the auras of others, this could be quite uncomfortable for those able to detect it due to its irregularity.<b>(Set to Hidden)</b></li>
        <li>Impassive: Ariean is what could be described as emotionless at times, while rare, every single one of his facial expressions is calculated, more often than not this elf will never display the emotion he is actually feeling, only ever displaying the emotion he wishes to convey, despite how rare such emotions are from him.</li><br>
