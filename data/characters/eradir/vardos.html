          <li><i>First Glances</i></li>
          <li>Physical Appearance: Unkempt dark brown hair, handsome features, blemished by a scar going across the length of his right eye. Possessive of all of the features that would define the man as a human male.</li>
          <li>Attire: Rarely ever seen in casual clothing, he'd always be seen in some sort of armour, be it light or heavy, this does not seem to change no matter if he's in a city or in the wilderness.</li>
          <li>Aura: While most beings both of a magical affinity, and not, radiate an aura, this man would not, in fact he would radiate nothing, appearing as more of a void in a surrounding space compared to the auras of others, this could be quite uncomfortable for those able to detect it due to its irregularity.</li>
          <li>A loss of control: Not quite himself.</li>

          <li><b>About</b></li>
          <li>A tanned human male that stands at the towering height of 6'7ft. Dishevelled, dark brown hair rests atop his head, flowing down to reach just past his shoulders, despite this rugged appearance there would be nothing to indicate the hair would be in a poor state.<br><br>

          His features are both striking and handsome, not often does a smile grace his features, his visage more often than not being a subdued one, betraying little in the way of emotions. The only thing that would tarnish his visage would be a scar that runs over his right eye, though given the eye is still functional, it is clear that it did not make contact with the eye itself.<br><br>
            
          He stands at just above six feet tall, his frame a muscular one, but even so it still yields to the characteristic litheness found on many who share his genetics, making his frame a slim, but muscular blend. His body is equally blemished, similar to his face, with various scars, of varying severity, present upon his form, though these are not often visible.</li><br><br>
          <li><b>True Description</b></li>
          <li>Vardos Eradir, once Prince of the Kingdom of Verdial and Wrath of the Pantheon of Gods, now King of the Verdian Kingdom. Vardos came to the planet of Azeroth approximately 14,835 years ago, during the days of the Kaldorei empire. From there he went on to found the region known Shalazir, located within the southern part of Kalimdor, however this ended in ruin when a civil war broke out among the people, instead of slaughter those he once considered allies he instead lead his people across the sea, creating a new land known as Etchfield, a land meant to embody the perfection Verdial once did. He recreated their language, their culture and even bestowed Veridian Magic onto those who would assist in the defense of their lands.<br><br>But Vardos had a wanderers heart, and because of this he appointed others to rule Etchfield while he journeyed the lands of Azeroth, exploring and fighting for the future of the world he now calls home, or at least the world he calls home temporarily.<br><br>While no longer possessing the full command of the divine powers he once did as the Wrath, he still benefits from the blessings he recieved upon becoming the wrath, including the superhuman strength, speed and stamina, and also his ability to bestow lesser divine magic on others.</li><br><br>
          <li><b>The Way of the Warrior</li></b><br><li>(Not an Oath, but a way that Vardos chooses to live.)</li><li>The Realms are Ours</b><br><br>Permit not god nor demon to defile the mortal realms, root out and destroy wheresoever they dare to encroach upon us.<br><br><br><b>Live for Yourself</b><br><br>To surrender ones life willingly is the ultimate defeat, never look to others to provide you with a reason for living and fight until your last. Death may have you when it earns you.<br><br><br><b>To the End</b><br><br>Never surrender to a foe or flee a battle, unless it is to save the lives of others, fight until the end.
          <br><br><br><li><b>The Oath of the Wrath (Broken)</li><li>Weapon of the Gods</b><br><br>As the Wrath of the Gods you exist to purge evil no matter where it is found.<br><br><br><b>Guard Against Chaos</b><br><br>Permit not the whispers of the corrupt to twist your mind, deny any falsehoods from the demons, they whisper only corruption.<br><br><br><b>Die In Service</b><br><br>To die in service of the gods is the highest honour, should you face death in your duties, face it with honour befitting a servant of the gods.<br><br><br><b>A Higher Will</b><br><br>The Pantheons authority is unmatched and unquestioned, you will follow your divine commandments to the letter and carry out your orders to the best of your ability, no matter what they may be.</li>
