          <li>A tanned Verdian male that stands at the height of 6'9ft. Curly black hair rests atop his head. Spending his time ruling from his throne, his armour would be more ceremonial than practical, not a scratch upon it, however despite this he would not be one to avoid getting his hands dirty, having a long history of conflict, having been trained as a Warrior, but giving up the path to rule.<br><br>His features would be considered handsome by the vast majority of those who meet him, he more often than not has a stoic expression on his face, appearing calm and collected the vast majority of the time. He has a variety of scars on his features, showing his history as a fighter.<br><br>He stands at the higher end of 6 feet, his frame a muscular one, plenty of visible muscle. His body is equally blemished, with a multitude of scars visible upon his form.</li>
          <li><b>True Description</b></li>
          <li>Lucius Eradir, King of Verdial and the Kingdom of Verdial, has had a life fraught with combat, spending most of the early years of his life and fufilling his duties as crown prince. When he was 8,082 his father Archaedius almost fell in battle against the demon Garesh, however it was later found out that he was corrupted, this led to him to go on a rampage throughout the spire, slaughtering many, and it was at the age of 8,103 that Lucius was given the divine task by the gods, a task which forced to slay his corrupted father.<br><br>After having done this he would then ascend to the throne at the age of 8,104, but he would not take a wife for many years after, while this era was considered a golden age by the Verdians, this was only due to threats never reaching the inner sectors of Kingdom space, which their King made sure of. Defeating the Aetherians in a rebellion orchestrated by rogue elements in their government, leading the defense against the wardens to stop them encroaching on Asaian territory and doing battle with the Ether on many distant worlds.<br><br>It would not be until he was 15,305 that he would finally take a wife, Mirandel, they would then a year later, have their first son, Versil. As the heir he saw that his son had all the training and skills he required but when he was 350 years old, his son renounced his heritage, denouncing his father and the royal family and joining the Wardens. Lucius would be without an heir for many years, his wife only giving birth to females, until when he was 16,832 that his wife gave birth to their son Asirion, who given Versil's disinteritance, became the new crown Prince.<br><br> The Golden age was ended when Versil returned to the capital, killed his father and imprisoned his mother, and usurped the throne, these events led the Kingdom to spiral into a civil war, divided by loyalists to the throne and loyalists to the true heir, fortunately due to Lucius dying before the sundering, he ascended to the realms of the gods, where he now lives.</li>
