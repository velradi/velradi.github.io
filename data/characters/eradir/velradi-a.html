          <li>Physical Appearance</li>
          <li>A tanned Verdian male that stands at the height of 6'3ft. His head would be completely shaved, having not a single trace of hair on top of his head, he would also have a full beard, dark brown in colour, despite this rugged appearance there would be nothing to indicate the hair of his beard would be in a poor state.<br><br>His features are both striking and handsome, not often does a smile grace his features, his visage more often than not being a subdued one, betraying little in the way of emotions. The only thing that would tarnish his visage would be a scar that runs over his right eye, though given the eye is still functional, it is clear that it did not make contact with the eye itself.<br><br>He stands at just above six feet tall, his frame a muscular one. His body is equally blemished, similar to his face, with various scars, of varying severity, present upon his form, though these are not often visible.</li><li><b>True Description</b></li>
          <li>Asirion Eradir, once Prince of the Kingdom of Verdial and Wrath of the Pantheon of Gods, now King of the Verdian Kingdom. Asirion has a long history of turmoil, waging war with his brother Versil, in a civil war which would destroy their society, their people and their cities, only to then lead to calamity when his sisters Alistan and Lysela unleashed the sundering, erasing all trace of the Verdian people, even their technology on other worlds was wiped out. Asirion along with a few others survived this event, Asirion himself declaring vengeance upon all who had contributed to and benefited from the sundering.<br><br>Asirion however during this warpath found a facility known as the Vault, using this authorisation as royalty he reactivated the Vault, and it's synthetic dwellers. He was then crowned King, and Sara his Queen and they set about rebuilding the Verdian society. Asirion however wished not only to get revenge on his siblings, but also to travel, so he left Sara in charge of the new Verdian Kingdom and set forth to journey alone.<br><br>While no longer possessing the full command of the divine powers he once did as the Wrath, he still benefits from the blessings he recieved upon becoming the wrath, including the superhuman strength, speed and stamina, and also his ability to bestow lesser divine magic on others.</li><br><br>
          <br><br><br><li><b>The Oath of the Wrath (Broken)</li><li>Weapon of the Gods</b><br><br>As the Wrath of the Gods you exist to purge evil no matter where it is found.<br><br><br><b>Guard Against Chaos</b><br><br>Permit not the whispers of the corrupt to twist your mind, deny any falsehoods from the demons, they whisper only corruption.<br><br><br><b>Die In Service</b><br><br>To die in service of the gods is the highest honour, should you face death in your duties, face it with honour befitting a servant of the gods.<br><br><br><b>A Higher Will</b><br><br>The Pantheons authority is unmatched and unquestioned, you will follow your divine commandments to the letter and carry out your orders to the best of your ability, no matter what they may be.</li>
          <br><br><br><li><b>Powers and Abilities</b></li><br><br>
          <li>Titanic Strength</li><br><li>Asirion has strength that rivals that of the gods and the titans that preceeded them, his raw strength is so great that he is capable of rending the earth apart with earthshattering stomps, hurling objects far larger than him across vast distances and having even been shown to be capable of lifting the combined weight of a planet. There are no equals to him in terms of raw strength and only with the enhancement of magic do others even come close to him.</li><br><br><li>Enhanced Dexterity</li><br><br><li>While strength is his defining characteristic he would posess great speed too, capable of moving at breakneck speeds, even while not in the air he is able to instantly move across vast distances, charging into battle at speeds that ordinary vision would have trouble keeping up with.</li><br><br><li>Invulnerability</li><br><br><li>Asirion has an invulnerability to all physical threats, the only exception is from enchanted weaponry, and magic in general, however he still possesses a greater resistance to magic than the average individual, weaker spells and enchantments will still have a diminished effect on him, despite being more effective than unenchanted weaponry. This invulnerability is carried over to almost everything, being unable to be hurt by anything that doesn't contain a trace of magic, be that the ground beneath him or weaponry such as missiles and explosives, magic within weaponry such as those mentioned used to be more common before the sundering, back in the Kingdom times, but with the diminishment of magic overall and the loss of the Kingdom and it's technology, it's significantly more rare.</li><br><br><li>Endless Stamina</li><br><br><li>While not infinite in the truest sense of the word, Asirion posesses a seemingly endless reserve of stamina, with it taking truly unique and powerful enemies to tire him, but on average most opponents he comes up against would not even come close to doing so. He is also more than capable of taking massive hits and still pushing through, with even the magical attacks of gods rarely enough to stop him or bring him down.</li><br><br><li>Veridian Sensitive</li><br><br><li>Owing to his unique heritage and position as a once servant of the gods, Asirion would possess the ability to call upon the gods divine magic, though at a drastically reduced rate from his earlier days as the Wrath, still capable of minor acts with the magic, as well as being able to bestow this magic upon others, albeit at an even further reduced effect.</li><br><br><li>Warp Magic</li><br><br><li>While  his connection to this magic was temporarily severed after the sundering due to the loss of the Warp Crystal, his connection was later restored via the Riftblade. Warp magic allows Asirion to bend space and instantaneously teleport across short distances, and long distances with greater effort, while much of the advanced warp magic techniques were lost, leading to very few other powers able to actually be harnessed by Asirion, at least for now.</li><br><br>
          <li>Flight</li><br><br><li>Asirion is capable of flight naturally, although when depleted or weakened it can make it harder, if not impossible for him to fly. He is capable of using his full strength, even while in the air, and capable of generating his own gravity, allowing him to push against the air, rather than requiring the ground to do so.</li>

      <p>His frame a muscular one, but even so it still yields to the characteristic litheness found on many who share his genetics, making his frame a slim, but muscular blend.
