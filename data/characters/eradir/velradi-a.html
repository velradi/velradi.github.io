          <li><i>First Glances</i></li>
          <li>Physical Appearance: Unkempt dark brown hair, handsome features, blemished by a scar going across the length of his right eye. Possessive of all of the features that would define the man as a human male.</li>
          <li>Attire: Rarely ever seen in casual clothing, he'd always be seen in some sort of armour, be it light or heavy, this does not seem to change no matter if he's in a city or in the wilderness.</li>
          <li>Aura: While most beings both of a magical affinity, and not, radiate an aura, this man would not, in fact he would radiate nothing, appearing as more of a void in a surrounding space compared to the auras of others, this could be quite uncomfortable for those able to detect it due to its irregularity.</li>
          <li>A loss of control: Not quite himself.</li>

          <li>A tanned human male that stands at the height of 6'6.7ft. Dishevelled, dark brown hair rests atop his head, flowing down to reach just past his shoulders, despite this rugged appearance there would be nothing to indicate the hair would be in a poor state.<br><br>His features are both striking and handsome, not often does a smile grace his features, his visage more often than not being a subdued one, betraying little in the way of emotions. The only thing that would tarnish his visage would be a scar that runs over his right eye, though given the eye is still functional, it is clear that it did not make contact with the eye itself.<br><br>He stands at just above six feet tall, his frame a muscular one, but even so it still yields to the characteristic litheness found on many who share his genetics, making his frame a slim, but muscular blend. His body is equally blemished, similar to his face, with various scars, of varying severity, present upon his form, though these are not often visible.</li><br><br>
          <li><b>True Description</b></li>
          <li>Asirion Eradir, once Prince of the Kingdom of Verdial and Wrath of the Pantheon of Gods, now King of the Verdian Kingdom. Asirion came to the planet of Azeroth approximately 14,835 years ago, during the days of the Kaldorei empire. From there he went on to found the region known Shalazir, located within the southern part of Kalimdor, however this ended in ruin when a civil war broke out among the people, instead of slaughter those he once considered allies he instead lead his people across the sea, creating a new land known as Etchfield, a land meant to embody the perfection Verdial once did. He recreated their language, their culture and even bestowed Veridian Magic onto those who would assist in the defense of their lands.<br><br>But Asirion had a wanderers heart, and because of this he appointed others to rule Etchfield while he journeyed the lands of Azeroth, exploring and fighting for the future of the world he now calls home, or at least the world he calls home temporarily.<br><br>While no longer possessing the full command of the divine powers he once did as the Wrath, he still benefits from the blessings he recieved upon becoming the wrath, including the superhuman strength, speed and stamina, and also his ability to bestow lesser divine magic on others.</li><br><br>
          <li><b>The Way of the Warrior</li></b><br><li>(Not an Oath, but a way that Asirion chooses to live.)</li><li>The Realms are Ours</b><br><br>Permit not god nor demon to defile the mortal realms, root out and destroy wheresoever they dare to encroach upon us.<br><br><br><b>Live for Yourself</b><br><br>To surrender ones life willingly is the ultimate defeat, never look to others to provide you with a reason for living and fight until your last. Death may have you when it earns you.<br><br><br><b>To the End</b><br><br>Never surrender to a foe or flee a battle, unless it is to save the lives of others, fight until the end.
          <br><br><br><li><b>The Oath of the Wrath (Broken)</li><li>Weapon of the Gods</b><br><br>As the Wrath of the Gods you exist to purge evil no matter where it is found.<br><br><br><b>Guard Against Chaos</b><br><br>Permit not the whispers of the corrupt to twist your mind, deny any falsehoods from the demons, they whisper only corruption.<br><br><br><b>Die In Service</b><br><br>To die in service of the gods is the highest honour, should you face death in your duties, face it with honour befitting a servant of the gods.<br><br><br><b>A Higher Will</b><br><br>The Pantheons authority is unmatched and unquestioned, you will follow your divine commandments to the letter and carry out your orders to the best of your ability, no matter what they may be.</li>
          <br><br><br><li><b>Powers and Abilities</b></li><br><br>
          <li>Titanic Strength</li><br><li>Asirion has strength that rivals that of the gods and the titans that preceeded them, his raw strength is so great that he is capable of rending the earth apart with earthshattering stomps, hurling objects far larger than him across vast distances and having even been shown to be capable of lifting the combined weight of a planet. There are no equals to him in terms of raw strength and only with the enhancement of magic do others even come close to him.</li><br><br><li>Enhanced Dexterity</li><br><br><li>While strength is his defining characteristic he would posess great speed too, capable of moving at breakneck speeds, even while not in the air he is able to instantly move across vast distances, charging into battle at speeds that ordinary vision would have trouble keeping up with.</li><br><br><li>Invulnerability</li><br><br><li>Asirion has an invulnerability to all physical threats, the only exception is from enchanted weaponry, and magic in general, however he still possesses a greater resistance to magic than the average individual, weaker spells and enchantments will still have a diminished effect on him, despite being more effective than unenchanted weaponry. This invulnerability is carried over to almost everything, being unable to be hurt by anything that doesn't contain a trace of magic, be that the ground beneath him or weaponry such as missiles and explosives, magic within weaponry such as those mentioned used to be more common before the sundering, back in the Kingdom times, but with the diminishment of magic overall and the loss of the Kingdom and it's technology, it's significantly more rare.</li><br><br><li>Endless Stamina</li><br><br><li>While not infinite in the truest sense of the word, Asirion posesses a seemingly endless reserve of stamina, with it taking truly unique and powerful enemies to tire him, but on average most opponents he comes up against would not even come close to doing so. He is also more than capable of taking massive hits and still pushing through, with even the magical attacks of gods rarely enough to stop him or bring him down.</li><br><br><li>Veridian Sensitive</li><br><br><li>Owing to his unique heritage and position as a once servant of the gods, Asirion would possess the ability to call upon the gods divine magic, though at a drastically reduced rate from his earlier days as the Wrath, still capable of minor acts with the magic, as well as being able to bestow this magic upon others, albeit at an even further reduced effect.</li><br><br><li>Warp Magic</li><br><br><li>While  his connection to this magic was temporarily severed after the sundering due to the loss of the Warp Crystal, his connection was later restored via the Riftblade. Warp magic allows Asirion to bend space and instantaneously teleport across short distances, and long distances with greater effort, while much of the advanced warp magic techniques were lost, leading to very few other powers able to actually be harnessed by Asirion, at least for now.</li><br><br>
          <li>Flight</li><br><br><li>Asirion is capable of flight naturally, although when depleted or weakened it can make it harder, if not impossible for him to fly. He is capable of using his full strength, even while in the air, and capable of generating his own gravity, allowing him to push against the air, rather than requiring the ground to do so.</li><br><br><br>
