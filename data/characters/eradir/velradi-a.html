          <li>Title: King of the Verdian Kingdom</li>
          <li>Race: Asaian (Higher Revenant)</li>
          <li>Class: Wayward King</li>
          <li>Age: Eternal (Timeless Essence) (Age: 16,368 At time of sundering)</li>
          <li>Eye Colour: Verdant</li>
          <li>Height: 6'1 ft (186.3 cm)</li>
          <li>Body Shape: Athletic (Mesomorph)</li>

          <li>Physical Appearance</li>
          <li>A tanned Verdian male that stands at the height of 6'1ft. Dishevelled, dark brown hair rests atop his head, flowing down to reach just above his shoulders, he would also have a full beard, dark brown in colour, despite this rugged appearance there would be nothing to indicate the hair of his beard would be in a poor state.<br><br>His features are both striking and handsome, not often does a smile grace his features, his visage more often than not being a subdued one, betraying little in the way of emotions. The only thing that would tarnish his visage would be a scar that runs over his right eye, though given the eye is still functional, it is clear that it did not make contact with the eye itself.<br><br>He stands at just above six feet tall, his frame a muscular one. His body is equally blemished, similar to his face, with various scars, of varying severity, present upon his form, though these are not often visible.</li><li><b>True Description</b></li>
          <li>Asirion Eradir, once Prince of the Kingdom of Verdial and Wrath of the Pantheon of Gods, now King of the Verdian Kingdom. Asirion has a long history of turmoil, waging war with his brother Versil, in a civil war which would destroy their society, their people and their cities, only to then lead to calamity when his sisters Alistan and Lysela unleashed the sundering, erasing all trace of the Verdian people, even their technology on other worlds was wiped out. Asirion along with a few others survived this event, Asirion himself declaring vengeance upon all who had contributed to and benefited from the sundering.<br><br>Asirion however during this warpath found a facility known as the Vault, using this authorisation as royalty he reactivated the Vault, and it's synthetic dwellers. He was then crowned King, and Sara his Queen and they set about rebuilding the Verdian society. Asirion however wished not only to get revenge on his siblings, but also to travel, so he left Sara in charge of the new Verdian Kingdom and set forth to journey alone.<br><br>While no longer possessing the full command of the divine powers he once did as the Wrath, he still benefits from the blessings he recieved upon becoming the wrath, including the superhuman strength, speed and stamina, and also his ability to bestow lesser divine magic on others.</li>
          <br><br><br><li><b>Greater Revenant</b></li><br>
          <li>Asirion was killed by his younger sister Lysela after the sundering, she used the remaining energy of the Warp Crystal to blast him through his core, killing him instantly, however he refused to die and he drew upon the remaining warp energy coursing through his body, this revived him, but condemned him to become a Revenant. A Greater Revenant is the same as a standard revenant, their bodies infused by energy and it is this energy that keeps them alive, however unlike a standard revenant, a Greater Revenant has an Essence, and this allows them to have an internal and recharging power source, meaning they cannot be depleted like a standard revenant.<br><br>However they still have the downsides of a revenant that they hunger for energy and will consume it when required, the difference is, the lack of absorbing energy will not kill a Greater Revenant, like it would a standard one. They also appear to be more alive than a standard revenant, usually a standard Revenant appears as more of an undead than a living being, with most of their bodily functions having ceased. A Greater Revenant still has bodily functions, they simply do not require their internal organs, as their energy will regenerate any damage given time, they are also usually indistinguishable from a living being, the only exception being when they are low on energy.</li><br>
          <li><b>Powers and Abilities</b></li><br><br>
          <li>Warped Strength</li><br><li>Upon his return, Asirions strength has increased to the point that it rivals that of the gods and the titans that preceeded them, his raw strength is so great that he is capable of rending the earth apart with earthshattering stomps, hurling objects far larger than him across vast distances and having even been shown to be capable of lifting the combined weight of a planet. While strength would not be what he often employs, there are few equals to him in terms of it.</li><br><br><li>Warped Dexterity</li><br><br><li>While Asirion was a particularly dexterous fighter before his transition into a Greater Revenant, his dexterity has increased substantially, being a warp-infused Revenant makes him able to draw upon the power as if it's second nature, teleporting instantaneously, moving at the speed of light and sometimes even beyond it under certain circumstances, allowing him to cross great distances in an instant, moving at speeds that most would not even be able to track.</li><br><br><li>Invulnerability</li><br><br><li>Upon his revival, Asirion has an invulnerability to all physical threats, the only exception is from enchanted weaponry, and magic in general, however he still possesses a greater resistance to magic than the average individual, weaker spells and enchantments will still have a diminished effect on him, despite being more effective than unenchanted weaponry. This invulnerability is carried over to almost everything, being unable to be hurt by anything that doesn't contain a trace of magic, be that the ground beneath him or weaponry such as missiles and explosives, magic within weaponry such as those mentioned used to be more common before the sundering, back in the Kingdom times, but with the diminishment of magic overall and the loss of the Kingdom and it's technology, it's significantly more rare. While these things can hurt him, they'll rarely kill him, with specalised Greater Revenant killing tools required, and even then he'll simply return after a time.</li><br><br><li>Endless Stamina</li><br><br><li>While not endless in the truest sense of the word, Asirion posesses a higher reserve of stamina, with it taking a long time for him to tire from things such as combat, on average most opponents he comes up against would not even come close to tiring him. He is also more than capable of taking massive hits and still pushing through, with even the magical attacks of gods rarely enough to stop him or bring him down, at least for an extended period.</li><br><br><li>Warp Magic</li><br><br><li>While his connection to this magic was temporarily severed after the sundering due to the loss of the Warp Crystal, his connection was later restored by his transition to a Greater Revenant. Warp magic allows Asirion to bend space and instantaneously teleport across short distances, and long distances with greater effort, while much of the advanced warp magic techniques were lost, leading to very few other powers able to actually be harnessed by Asirion, at least for now.</li><br><br>

His body is equally blemished, similar to his face, with various scars, of varying severity, present upon his form, though these are not often visible. He has a variety of tattoos covering his body, in various runic symbols.</li><li><b>True Description</b></li>
          <li>Asirion Eradir, came to Azeroth approximately 14.485 years ago, during the times of the ancient Kaldorei empire. The form of Asirion Eradir however, he could not take during this time given the lack of any Verdian looking races, and as such he has only been around in this form since the de-evolution of the vrykul and the subsequent creation of humanity, spending his time during the early days of human society when humans were tribal and barely had a cohesive society.<br><br>Since the founding of the first human Kingdoms however, he has spent a great deal of his time fighting for his temporary home of Azeroth from a myriad of threats, despite the taste of war long having grown sour to him, he still fought to defend his new home and people all the same.</li><br><br>
          <li>Powers and Abilities</li><br>
          <li>He retains all powers and abilities mentioned above, given this is his primary vessel, with no diminishment suffered like that of his other shadow selves.</li>
