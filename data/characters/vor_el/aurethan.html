        <li><i>First Glances</i></li>
        <li>Physical Appearance: Unkempt dark brown hair, handsome features, blemished by a scar going across the length of his right eye. Possessive of all of the features that would define the man as a Thalassian male.</li>
        <li>A loss of control: Not quite himself. <b>(Set to Hidden)</b></li>
        <li>Attire: Rarely ever seen in casual clothing, he'd always be seen in some sort of armour, be it light or heavy, this does not seem to change no matter if he's in a city or in the wilderness.</li>
        <li>Aura: While most beings both of a magical affinity, and not, radiate an aura, this man would not, in fact he would radiate nothing, appearing as more of a void in a surrounding space compared to the auras of others, this could be quite uncomfortable for those able to detect it due to its irregularity. <b>(Set to Hidden)</b></li>

        <li><b>About</b></li>
        <li>Pet Name: Lokir</li>
        <li>A tanned thalassian male that stands at just over six feet tall. Dishevelled, dark brown hair rests atop his head, flowing down to reach just past his shoulders, despite this rugged appearance there would be nothing to indicate the hair would be in a poor state.<br><br>His features are both striking and handsome, not often does a smile grace his features, his visage more often than not being a subdued one, betraying little in the way of emotions. The only thing that would tarnish his visage would be a scar that runs over his right eye, though given the eye is still functional, it is clear that it did not make contact with the eye itself.<br><br>He stands at just above six feet tall, his frame a muscular one, but even so it still yields to the characteristic litheness found on many an elf, making his frame a slim, but muscular blend. His body is equally blemished, similar to his face, with various scars, of varying severity, present upon his form, though these are not often visible.</li><br><br>
        <li><b>True Description</b></li>
        <li>Cercila Taran, shadow self to Asirion, otherwise known as Velradi.<br><br>He took this form when the original Aurethan fell in battle at the attack on Quel'thalas by the scourge, he has since used this form to keep an eye on Quel'thalas and it's interests, given their close proximity to Etchfield, with most of his time having been spent in the city.</li><br><br><br>
