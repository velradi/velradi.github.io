        <li><i>First Glances</i></li>
        <li>Appearance: This elf stands at average height for Quel'Dorei, he has sky blue kinda glowing eyes, along with very dark blue-ish and black hair and goatee beard, it doesn't take a strong eye to see he certainly takes care of his physical appearance.</li>
        <li>Outfit: Leorian can be seen as mildly armoured at all times, with a light chest plate, along with brown leather pants and leather on his wrists, wears a black cape wich connects to his hood.</li>
        <li>Aura: A strong magical aura can be felt for the ones who wield or sense such magic, and can be clearly seen this man oozes magic. Though, should someone be good at sensing aura's one could tell he's hidden shadow-energy within him, as he's pretty good at hiding it.</li>
        <li>No 'Real' Sight: Due to recent events, Leorian has no eyesight. Though, has replaced it by using Arcane magic to see the outlines of others, his hearing and senses have become stronger by an significant amount given he has to rely on that most of the time.</li><br>
