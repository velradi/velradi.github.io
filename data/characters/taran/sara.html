          <li>A tanned Verdian female that stands at the height of 5'6ft. Orderly and wavy dark brown hair rests atop her head, the hair flowing down, reaching just past her upper back. Despite this more refined appearance she would not be one to avoid getting her hands dirty, having been trained as a Valkyrie.<br><br>Her features would be considered beautiful by the vast majority of those who meet her, she more often than not has a smile on her lips, appearing approachable, but more than capable of being stoic and subdued when the situation calls for it. She has nary a scar or blemish on her features, despite being part of a combat focused order most of her life.<br><br>She stands at the higher end of 5 feet, her frame a slim, but toned one, plenty of visible muscle. Her body is equally unblemished, with not a single scar visible upon her form.</li>
          <li><b>True Description</b></li>
          <li>Sara Eradir, former Valkyrie of the Kingdom of Verdial, was always set to become Queen, even in the days before the sundering she was selected to be Asirion's bride, and one day they would be wed. However such was not to be, dying in the events prior to the sundering, this led to her dying and her esscence being displaced by the release of energy from the sundering, sent to the realm of purgatory, like so many others who died just before the sundering. However this was not to be her fate, Asirion journeyed into the realm of purgatory, retrieving her essence and placing her into a genetically created Verdian body. While this took some adjustment, she would later marry Asirion, the rightful heir to the throne, making her Queen of the Verdian Kingdom, always having a gift for command, she was left to ensure the new Verdians continued to flourish, while King Asirion went off to explore the stars.</li>
