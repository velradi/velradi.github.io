        <li><i>First Glances</i></li>
        <li>Appearance: A woman with an air of mystery tanned unblemished olive skin, natural brunette hair, average sized ears and perceptive verdant irises. Having most of the identifiable characteristics of her fellow kin.</li>
        <li>Attire: Commonly seen in casual clothing and hardly ever seen in armour.</li>
        <li>Injuries: -</li>
        <li>Aura: While most beings both of a magical affinity, and not, radiate an aura, this woman would not, in fact she would radiate nothing, appearing as more of a void in a surrounding space compared to the auras of others, this could be quite uncomfortable for those able to detect it due to its irregularity.</li>
        <li>Enigma: The woman more often than not maintains the same neutral facial expressionwhen seen outside of social interactions, for this reason it's often impossible to understand her intentions or emotions from mere facial expressions alone given she will often convey the emotion she wishes to rather than what she actually feels.</li>

      {p:c}{col:d3d9d9}Hair that never stays a single shade for long and observant verdant irises, it is clear that even physically, her appearance evokes a sense of mystery. Cercila stands at the modest height of 5'3, a height not often seen in her fellow human kin. Her face would be one of untouched perfection, not a single blemish or alteration anywhere upon her features. Her ears are pointed, knife-like as is to be expected, her ears adorned by a matching pair of diamond earrings, located upon the lobe of her ears. Like the rest of her appearance her hair is pristine, nary a hair out of place, it trailing to reach just past the middle of her back.<br><br>
      
      Cercila appears to be a refined individual, one born into a life of splendour and absent of burden, however should she flex, one might realise how physically capable she is, despite seemingly any visible reason to bother with doing so, she retains a strict training regieme, as shown by her slim but toned figure.{/p}<br><br>

{p:c}{col:d3d9d9}Cercila retains a neutral expression whenever she is idle, however the moment she finds herself in conversation her expression can vary immensely, while talking she will rarely be seen without a smile upon her lips, appearing engaged and approachable in whatever social situation she should find herself in. <br><br>

But when it comes to talking about herself she will often be evasive, elusive and uninterested in discussing such things, finding more intrigue in asking others questions rather than answering them herself.{/p}<br><br>
