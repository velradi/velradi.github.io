        <li><i>First Glances</i></li>
        <li>Appearance: A woman with an air of mystery tanned unblemished tanned skin, natural brunette hair, average sized ears and perceptive verdant irises. Having most of the identifiable characteristics of her fellow kin.</li>
        <li>Attire: Commonly seen in casual clothing and hardly ever seen in armour.</li>
        <li>Injuries: -</li>
        <li>(HIDDEN GLANCE) Aura: While most beings both of a magical affinity, and not, radiate an aura, this woman would not, in fact she would radiate nothing, appearing as more of a void in a surrounding space compared to the auras of others, this could be quite uncomfortable for those able to detect it due to its irregularity.</li>
        <li>(HIDDEN GLANCE) Enigma: The woman more often than not maintains the same neutral facial expressionwhen seen outside of social interactions, for this reason it's often impossible to understand her intentions or emotions from mere facial expressions alone given she will often convey the emotion she wishes to rather than what she actually feels.</li>

        <li><b>True Description</b></li>
        <li>Cercila Eradir, shadow self to Vardos Eradir, once known as Asirion Eradir.<br><br>It was within this form that he took to Free Space and worked as a smuggler, and which he also undertook many other different and varied ventures, such as exploring the crime-ridden underworld of Asaia.</li><br><br>
        <li><b>Powers and Abilities</b></li><br><br>
        <li>Enhanced Strength</li><li>Cercila has strength that rivals that of the gods, while her raw strength is not as enhanced as her speed, it is still great enough for her to punch through solid Veridian Steel and also be capable of lifting objects that an ordinary Verdian would have great difficulty doing so, able to hurl objects far larger than her at great distances and also rend the earth with stomps. There are plenty of equals to her in terms of raw strength but that wouldn't be her most powerful asset.</li><br><br><li>Titanic Dexterity</li><li>While strength is not her defining characteristic speed definitely would be. She would posess great speed, capable of moving at breakneck speeds, even while not in the air she is able to instantly move across vast distances, teleporting and moving at speeds which ordinary vision would have trouble keeping up with. Her speed rivals that of both gods, and the titans that preceeded them, able to move beyond the speed of light.</li><br><br><li>Invulnerability</li><li>Cercila has an invulnerability to all physical threats, the only exception is from enchanted weaponry, and magic in general, however she still possesses a greater resistance to magic than the average individual, weaker spells and enchantments will still have a diminished effect on her, despite being more effective than unenchanted weaponry. This invulnerability is carried over to almost everything, being unable to be hurt by anything that doesn't contain a trace of magic, be that the ground beneath her or weaponry such as missiles and explosives, magic within weaponry such as those mentioned used to be more common before the sundering, back in the Kingdom times, but with the diminishment of magic overall and the loss of the Kingdom and it's technology, it's significantly more rare.</li><br><br><li>Endless Stamina</li><li>While not infinite in the truest sense of the word, Cercila posesses a seemingly endless reserve of stamina, with it taking truly unique and powerful enemies to tire her, but on average most opponents she comes up against would not even come close to doing so. She is also more than capable of taking massive hits and still pushing through, with even the magical attacks of gods rarely enough to stop her or bring her down.</li><br><br><li>Veridian Sensitive</li><li>Owing to her unique heritage and position as a once servant of the gods, Cercila would possess the ability to call upon the gods divine magic, though at a drastically reduced rate from her earlier days as the Wrath, still capable of minor acts with the magic, as well as being able to bestow this magic upon others, albeit at an even further reduced effect.</li><br><br><li>Warp Magic</li><li>While  her connection to this magic was temporarily severed after the sundering due to the loss of the Warp Crystal, her connection was later restored and made innate via the Riftblade. Warp magic allows Cercila to bend space and instantaneously teleport across short distances, and long distances with greater effort, while much of the advanced warp magic techniques were lost, leading to very few other powers able to actually be harnessed by Cercila, at least for now.</li><br><br>

      {p:c}{col:d3d9d9}Hair that never stays a single shade for long and observant verdant irises, it is clear that even physically, her appearance evokes a sense of mystery. Cercila stands at the modest height of 5'6, a height  fairly commonly seen among her fellow human kin. Her face would be one of untouched perfection, not a single blemish or alteration anywhere upon her features. Like the rest of her appearance her hair is pristine, nary a hair out of place, it trailing to reach just past the middle of her back.<br><br>
      
      Cercila appears to be a refined individual, one born into a life of splendour and absent of burden, however should she flex, one might realise how physically capable she is, despite seemingly any visible reason to bother with doing so, she retains a strict training regieme, as shown by her slim but toned figure.{/p}<br><br>

{p:c}{col:d3d9d9}Cercila retains a neutral expression whenever she is idle, however the moment she finds herself in conversation her expression can vary immensely, while talking she will rarely be seen without a smile upon her lips, appearing engaged and approachable in whatever social situation she should find herself in. <br><br>

But when it comes to talking about herself she will often be evasive, elusive and uninterested in discussing such things, finding more intrigue in asking others questions rather than answering them herself.{/p}<br><br>
