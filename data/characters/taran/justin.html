          <li><b>Description</b></li>
          <li>A tanned Verdian male that stands at the height of 6'5ft. Curly dark brown hair rests atop his head. Despite his more refined appearance, denoting him as an heir to a noble house, he would not be one to avoid getting his hands dirty, having been trained as a Warrior.<br><br>His features would be considered handsome by the vast majority of those who meet him, he more often than not has a smile on his lips, appearing humourous and jovial the vast majority of the time. He has nary a scar or blemish on his features, despite being part of a combat focused order most of his life.<br><br>He stands at the middle of 6 feet, his frame a slim, but muscular one, plenty of visible muscle. His body is equally unblemished, with not a single scar visible upon his form.</li>
          <li><b>True Description</b></li>
          <li>Justin Taran was a warrior of the Kingdom that existed during the time before the sundering, growing to become one of the crown princes best friends, the two were inseperable, training together, spending many holidays together and much of their overall lives together. Asirion's friendship with Justin was so great that when he left Kingdom space to explore, he gave Justin the title of Lord-Regent, allowing him to command the warriors in his absence. Long did this comradery exist between the two, that was until the civil war.<br><br>A difference in opinion formed between the two, while Asirion wished to regain his father's throne, Justin believed a civil war would further destabilise the Kingdom and leave them weaker, so when Asirion asked him to help, he refused, instead siding with Versil, the disinherited Eradir that currently sat the throne. He would commit himself to the cause of the loyalists, attempting to destroy Asirion's rebellion to prevent further deaths. This came to a head during the final battle in Asaia, only minutes before the sundering, Justin was forced to kill his own sister, Sara, due to her being on the opposing side, although not wishing to kill her, he had to stay true to his side.<br><br>When Asirion showed up, he watched Sara die in his arms, this enraging Asirion so much that Asirion and Justin engaged in a battle to the death, Asirion emerged victorious, instead of killing Justin however he left him to bleed out, while going into the Throne Room to confront his brother, Versil. Justin died, bleeding out, however he was not quite quick enough to die, since he died just moments before the sundering hit, this led to his essence being hit by the sundering, and causing him to be fractured like the rest of the Verdian race, forever unwhole, and unable to remember his previous life, his fragments constantly rebirthed into new mortal beings.</li>
