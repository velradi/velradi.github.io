<h2>A General Overview</h2>
<p>After the sundering, Asirion Eradir, surviving Prince and heir to the royal throne happened upon this world. It was here that he found a place, simply dubbed 'The Facility', a vault containing an archive of Verdian knowledge and history in the event, like that of the sundering, ever took place, and led to the death of most of their people. Having royal authorisation he opened the vault, and activated it.<br><br>He found a group of inactive synthetics that, after hearing about the calamity, began to prepare for the revitalisation of the Verdian race. They took pure, genetic samples, of the Verdian race stored within the Vault and fertilised eggs kept in storage, this allowed them to create the first of the new Verdians, the Synthetics took over leadership roles until Verdians came of age to do so, and overtime their small settlement flourished into a full-blown city, Verdial Prime, they would continue to expand this city as needed, rather than having the chaotic multiple city system Verdial had, New Verdial would opt for a single city, with constant expansion to house everyone.</p>
