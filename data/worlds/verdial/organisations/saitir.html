    <h2>General Overview</h2>
    <p>The Saitir, while a seperate organisation, is funded by the Hand of Creation, functioning as one of the most prestigious schools within Asaia, only the upper crust of society ever attend this school. This school has been attended by every member of the royal family to date, as well as the vast majority of the noble families. They teach almost any subject that an Asaian would be expected to be knowledgeable within, including the Asaian Language, known as Verdian, the Common Language and also a brief instruction on each other variant of the Verdian tongue spoken on Asaia.<br><br> The High Language is not commonly taught here, with most of those who learn it learning it through the Hand of Creation. Once they graduate Saitir, a student then chooses what their path will be, with Saitir being partnered with many of the organisations in not just Asaia, but Verdial itself, allowing its students, after graduation, to undertake many different callings, including that of the Warriors, Valkyries, Acolytes, Sorcerers and more. Those who are discovered to be Veridian Sensitive are often fast-tracked into the first two, should they choose to undertake it.</p>
