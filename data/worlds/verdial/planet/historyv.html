        <h2>General Overview</h2>
        <p>All history contained in here is not all he history of the universe, but merely the history that has affected Verdial. BGC stands for Before Golden City, AGC stands for After Golden City.</p><br>
        <h3>(2.8 million BGC - 2. million BGC)</h3>
        <h2>The Dawn Era</h2><p>The Dawn Era was the age where Verdial was first created, then subsequently seeded with lie. Among these races, sentient life was created, these were the wise Elves, the industrious Dwarves and the mighty Giants. These were the first races on the planet, though during the early era this age was heavily in favour of the Giants, with giants and proto-beasts roaming the surface, holding dominance over the land, and this would be the case for many more years,</p><br>
        <h3>(2.2 million BGC - 2 million BGC)</h3>
        <h2>The Solarstorm</h2><p>600,000 years after The Dawn Era, the first disaster came, within their sector the gods and the ether were doing battle above their planet, this battle released energy which struck the surface of the planet, while the atmosphere diffused much of it this event would forever change the future of the planet and the species on it. While this didn't have much of an initial effect on the land it did lead to the deaths of many beings on the planet.</p><br>
        <h3>(2 million BGC - 1.6 million BGC)</h3>
        <h2>The Awakening</h2><p>The infusion of The Solarstorm led to the awakening of the planets world soul earlier than intended, this caused a cataclysm of changes, while not enough to split the land as would come later, eruptions of volcanos, tsunamis and other disasterous events would befall the land, leading to the deaths of hundreds of thousands due to this unintended awakening.</p><br>
        <h3>(1.6 million BGC - 1 million BGC)</h3>
        <h2>Alterations</h2><p>For the next 600,000 years, many of the sentient races underwent drastic changes due to the now present divine energy infused into not just their world but the flora, the animals they hunted and the water they drank. This caused changes in many of them, the Elves began to grow more intelligent, the dwarves grew to be more hardy and enduring and the giants began to give birth to small, malformed creatures that would eventually become known as half-giants.</p><br>
        <h3>(1 million BGC - 650,000 BGC)</h3>
        <h2>Rise of Elvenkind</h2><p>Over this period the elves began to construct new tools, though the dwarves had been constructing tools for generations, these tools had a greater purpose, instead of for mining or hunting. These tools were created to deal with the two main problems befalling the elves. The proto-beasts and the giants. The Proto-beasts had already begun to shrink in size with each generation following The Solarstorm, which made them easier to hunt for anyone who wasn't a giant, and so the elves began to hunt these great beasts, building up settlements and chasing the beasts from their lands. The giants were also hunted by the elves, while the giants were physically strong, the elves new weaponry were able to overcome this significant disadvantage.</p><br>
        <h3>(650,000 BGC - 100,000 BGC)</h3>
        <h2>Birth of an Empire</h2><p>The rise of the elven empire began here. During this age they began to work together, forming what would eventually be known as the Elven Empire. While they still had no official capital they started to begin work on siege weapons, giants had began to construct their own tools of war but it was too late for them, with the siege weapons the giants were permanently routed from the central land of Verdial, and forced to hide in the southern part of Verdial.</p><br>
        <h3>(100,000 BGC - 0 BGC)</h3>
        <h2>Jewel of Verdial</h2><p>In this age the elves continued to unify, pooling their resources together, the site of what would become known as The Golden City, the crown jewel of their empire, while the building took time, the elves would enslave other races, mainly the dwarves and the newly discovered gnomes, believed to be a variant of dwarves with more intellect that splintered from the dwarves back in 850,000 BGC. They chose a lake that contained a vast reseviour of what came to be known as magic, and built the Golden City around it, creating a structure around the lake, this well would become known as The Font of Life.</p><br>
        <h3>(0 BGC - 100,000 AGC)</h3>
        <h2>Expansion</h2><p>With the construction of their capital nearing completion, the elves turned their gaze outwards, to the other territories of Verdial, seeking to expand their influence, and the amount of slaves they had at their disposal. The giants were considered to be too dangerous, a select few were only ever enslaved with the vast majority being killed on sight. During this time they founded cities to the North, East and West, daring not to go too far in either direction however due to the rather inhospitable conditions outside the central region of Verdial. Late into this age they also discovered the Aerir, a race that seems to be a further de-evolution from that of half-giants, this race had just enough strength to be suited for manual labour but not enough strength that they'd be hard to control.</p><br>
        <h3>(100,000 AGC - 300,000 AGC)</h3>
        <h2>Uncontested</h2><p>During this age the elves ruled uncontested, those that wished to live free, like that of the Aerir, had to hide deep in the southern jungles to evade the elves. Giants had become a rare sight, believed to be almost extinct. Dwarves and Gnomes that were not enslaved were rarely ever seen on the surface, believed to have a subterranian city, though no signs of such a city were ever found by the empire.</p><br>
        <h3>(300,000 AGC - 350,000 AGC)</h3>
        <h2>Rise of the Aerir</h2><p>A significant amount of time had passed since the enslavement of the Aerir, while societally shunned, some elves did have relations with the slaves under their control, leading to the birth of unique Aerir which were more physically attractive than that of other Aerir, they were also superior physically, having better strength, speed and endurance, though perhaps most uniquely they had access to the magics that the well provided to the elves, while most of the first of these unique Aerir were unaware of their powers, overtime they would become aware of it, many choosing to hide these powers, though it could not remain a secret forever.</p><br>
        <h3>(350,000 AGC - 355,000 AGC)</h3>
        <h2>Beginning of the End</h2><p>While the elves were unaware of it, the birth of these new Aerir spelled doom for their entire empire, the Emperor clearly realised the threat these newborn Aerir could present, especially now that it was almost common knowledge that these children could utilise the well. These Aerir started to be rounded up and executed, though many parents took precautions to see that their children survived, this would be a crucial turning point in the history of the entire planet.</p><br>
        <h3>(355,000 AGC - 356,500 AGC)</h3>
        <h2>Uprising</h2><p>During this time the Aerir that were born began to in secret learn how to harness their powers, as well as get their hands on weaponry from elven sympathisers, until the later point of the era where a full blown civil war erupted.</p><br>
        <h3>(356,000 - 356,018 AGC)</h3>
        <h2>The Sundering</h2><p>The uprising continued on for 18 years, constant fighting across the city, while the central part of the city was mostly spared from the fighting, uprisings occured all across the outskirts, and in various different territories. This led to a final battle in the year 344,482 AGC, a cataclysmic event known as the sundering occured, the constant battling of both the rebels and the empire caused the well to grow unstable from its use, the elves attempted to sever the connection of the Aerir magic users from the well and this was the final straw, the well detonated, flooding the entire city but having far more disasterous consequences, all over the land shifted and broke apart, cities were swallowed by the earth and the world itself rendered into an unstable and fractured group of continents, with a near constant storm that would persist for 100 years. During this time 99% of all elves died, along with a lot of other races such as giants and non-enhanced Aerir, the subterranian city of the dwarves and gnomes also collapsed during this time, killing all who couldn't make it out of the city before the sundering, a vast majority of the Aerir rebels managed to survive however.</p><br>
        <h3>(356,018 AGC - 356,100 AGC)</h3>
        <h2>A land undone</h2><p>It took approximately 100 years for the storms to subside and the continents to stop being overwhelmed by constant tidal waves and tsunamis, and a further 918 years for the planet to actually become stable enough for civilisation to begin to rebuild, during this time most surviving races lived nomadically, traveling around their continent in order to survive, having to flee before a flood kiled them, or the earth collapsed, and so on.</p><br>
        <h3>(356,100 AGC - 367,000 AGC)</h3>
        <h2>The Rebuilding</h2>
        <p>It took approximately 3,000 years for any sort of substantial rebuilding efforts to be made. Many different events occured during this time such as the Aerir of the isles meeding other Aerir survivors, both on and off the isles. During this time Aerir survivors on the central isles receeded the water that had flooded the city and began to rebuild the destroyed city, having to also deal with elven survivors who wanted their city back. <br><br>The Night City lowered their barrier and the surviving Aerir began to explore their changed land, while also building up outposts. The Aerir survivors of Shairan began to rebuild their ruined city, while also adapting to their change of climate. The Osiria Aerir survivors were dealing with the vast majority of their land still being flooded, making it a swamp now, leading to them living by the coasts and building up villages there. Those within the northern wastes were still dealing with encroaching giants, leaving them little time to rebuild. The majority of the survivors in Sultan were unenhanced Aerir but they still built small villages.<br><br> This is also believed to be the time period when Aerir survivors went to one of the isles and named it Shalar, and build up a small town on there, isolated from the larger community. The people of Shalar would also complete construction of a massive city, using their newly rediscovered arcane magic to both construct and levitate  the city into the sky, founding the magical marvel of a city which would come to be known as Shalazir.</p><br>
        <h3>(367,000 AGC - 400,000 AGC)</h3>
        <h2>The Fires of War</h2><p>This was a period of time where wide-scale wars were once again present. The Aerir that would become known as Nymerians had constructed seafaring vessels and had begun to sail across the seas, raiding and pillaging anything they could. Due to their environment they lacked many things such as various metals, and an abundance of crop harvests which other regions like the isles had in huge amounts. The fighting continued for many years with raids taking place all over the planet. However the most disasterous loss was yet to come.<br><br>The city of Shalazir was impervious during this time, completely unable to be raided due to the inability of the people of Nymeria to reach them, however they had constructed harpoon-like devices that would allow them to utilise their ships to tear the city from the sky, this resulted in the death of almost everyone within the city, with the city breaking apart and falling underneath the waves.<br><br> This act of heinous destruction would ultimately lead to a combined effort of all the other Aerir survivors to attack the people of Nymeria, with the Aerir of the isles having constructed their own ships, this battle led to the destruction of almost all of the navel presence of Nymeria and the bombardment from cannons on the city reducing their city to a ruin, they were then left to the ruins of their society, with any Nymerian ships from this point onward being attacked and destroyed on sight.</p><br>
        <h3>(400,000 AGC - 484,500 AGC)</h3>
        <h2>The Unification</h2>
        <p>This was a time of unification for most of the Aerir surivors, they had come together to form a unified world government, which they called the Verdian Institute. Each region, each region would have a council member appointed to it, with the only exception being that of the Nymerian Aerir, who were not invited to join this new global initiative.<br><br> They also jointly decided their race, instead of being known as Aerir, which is the elven word for slave, would call themselves Verdians, and each region would choose a name for their specific set of Verdians. So were the monikers we know today as Asaian, Shalaziri, Osirian, Shailan and so on, the Aerir of Nymeria chose the name of Nymerian for their people, refusing to allow this Institute to grant them a name not of their choosing. The rest of this time was mainly spent with the newborn Institute finding its footing as a new government.</p><br>
        <h3>(484,500 AGC - 515,000 AGC)</h3>
        <h2>Foundations</h2>
        <p>This time was spent with much of the technological development that would still be seen throughout Verdial today, including the spire, the plasma stations and much of the overall powergrid. VerTech was, naturally, instrumental in this era, and cemented themselves as crucial, not only to Verdial but to all of the Kingdom, their efforts in this time is why they are still so prevelant today.<br><br> Many other technological innovations occured during this time, the first plasma core was constructed and allowed for the Verdians to send the first ships into space, in greater number and greater frequency this time than the rocket technology they had been using before.</p><br>
        <h3>(515,000 AGC - 543,000 AGC)</h3>
        <h2>Rising Tensions</h2>
        <p>This was an unusual long age of what can only be amounted to rising tensions across the globe, Osiris and Nymeria had begun to grow increasingly more hostile towards each other given the raids that Nymeria was launching at Osiris, given that Osiris had recently begun construction on their underwater city this was hampering their efforts. While the Asaians stepped in with their fleet most of the time to assist the raids were far too frequent to police properly, and keep their own territory secure. For the Asaians had begun to have disagreements with Sultan, this started when the city outright rejected to join the Initiative and had begun expanding their arsenal of weapons, many believed open war was all but inevitable between the two cities. Shaotau had began to have disputes with the northern region, another region that hadn't joined the Initiative, Shaotau, but mainly VerTech, had wished to construct plasma pumps in the North to harvest the plasma within their frozen oceans but the people of Northelm vehemently refused any such attempts, even when resources and funds were promised. It was only Nymeria that remained oddly absent, though perhaps to be expected given the Nymerians were still attempting to rebuild what remained of their society in the last war.</p><br>
        <h3>(543,000 AGC - 543,500 AGC)</h3>
        <h2>The Doom of Sultan</h2>
        <p>During this era hostilities between Asaia and Sultan were at a breaking point, but the problem would end up resolving itself, as the people of Sultan had created a weapon, based on the werewolf curse they attempted to create a new breed of supersoldiers, and this ended in failure.<br><br> Little is known of how it started since none from the city survived to tell the tale, all that was left to go on was the statements of those of the Asaian fleet that arrived to quell the escaped monstrosities, but it is believed the experiments broke free from wherever they were being contained within the City, the majority of the cities population was either dead or infected when the Asaians arrived.<br><br> They made the difficult choice of using their airborne ships to annihilate the city, destroying all life within it, as it was the sole city in Sultan, this essentially wiped out their people, leaving very few to little left to wander around in nomadic tribes, a practice which they still continue to this day.</p>
        <h3>(543,500 AGC - 545,000 AGC)</h3>
        <h2>Return of Nymeria</h2>
        <p>In this era the Nymerians returned to the global stage, while they had been doing the occasional raids on Osiris to little success, they sought entry into the institute which remained a contentious debate throughout this era given the still high distrust of Nymerians in general. Nymerians didn't have the resources to rebuild their capital in full, while they did rebuilt the main palace around the nightwell and some of the houses around there, most of the buildings had been replaced by slums to consolidate their limited resources. Despite the war of the Nymerians being over 100,000 years prior the hatred for the Nymerians had not diminished globally.</p><br>
        <h3>(545,000 AGC - 548,000 AGC)</h3>
        <h2>Nightfall</h2>
        <p>Tensions between Asaia and Nymeria escalated to a breaking point when the Asaians reported that the Nymerians had attempted to attack their fleet, this paused their application status to the Institute, but Asaia was out for blood. They then began a war that would span 3,000 years. They destroyed the Nymerian vessels defending their shores with little effort, then landed their own forces on the lands of Nymeria, the King of Asaia being among them, this area became known as King's Ascent, which it is still known as to the current era. While the Nymerians fought hard to defend their land they were no match for the unique brand of warrior at the time known as Sunseekers, warriors who could wield wind and sand to destroy their enemies.<br><br>As the Nymerians were pushed further and further back, the Nymerians changed their tactics, deploying their new force of assassins, known as Shadows, they were trained specifically to fight the Sunseekers, relying on sneak attacks and obscuring the warriors vision to succeed. For a time the Nymerians began to regain ground but as more and more shadows fell their position became indefensible and they retreated back further into the forests. The land itself that Asaia occupied on Nymeria changed, almost as if the Nightwell specifically refused to infuse that part of the land and the land within this region reverted to it's natural state, a desert similar to that of Shairan.<br><br>The last 150 years of the war were spent in a cold war, with neither side being able to push for more land against the other, Asaians had weapons in development that would likely have won them the war but for some unbeknownst reason they offered peace terms to Nymeria, in it the terms were simple, the Nymerians would forfeit all claims to the lands Asaia had taken in the war, and Asaia would also forfeit claims to the remaining territories they had not conquered, both sides were also expected to not to take further hostilities against each other. This brought an end to their 3,000 year war, leaving Asaia stronger than ever and Nymeria rejected from joining the Institute.</p><br>
        <h3>(548,000 AGC - 555,832 AGC)</h3>
        <h2>Dawn of Asaia</h2>
        <p>The Asaians rose to great prominence in the rare era of peace that followed, they had far more military might, economic power and overall population compared to their contemparies in the Institute, this led to them gaining more power in the institute as a whole, perhaps seeing the coming change, VerTech became more intergrated and vital to Asaian society, cementing themselves as an ally, despire finding their origins in Shaotau, most would consider VerTech at this point to be an Asaian company than a Shailan one.<br><br>Barbarian hordes from the Northern Wastes also set sail in this era began to raid towns and villages, though they were quickly quelled by the advanced technologies of Asaia, with Asaia presenting themselves as a defender of the world, further increasing their power over their fellow nations.</p><br>
        <h3>(555,832 AGC - 568,083 AGC)</h3>
        <h2>The Dragonbane War</h2>
        <p>Tensions between Dragon and Asaian had always been shaky at best, before the elves came the land the Asaians inhabit used to be known as the Dragonvale, and ever since the sundering the dragons have still referred to it as the Dragon Isles. Viewing the Asaians as foolish mortals, undeserving of their place as caretakers of the land. It is not known what ignited this war, though it is widely believed that a black dragon attacked a village on Asaia which started this war, the dragons would lay siege to fortresses and towns on the isles that were under the Asaians control, while their technological advantage allowed them to hold back the dragons it wasn't enough. So they developed specalised weapons known as Dragonkillers, which could launch plasma-infused spears that would piece through a dragons armoured scales where their usual weaponry could not, some even had chains on them to pull the dragons from the sky.<br><br>The Dragonslayers would also come into existence during this time, using a specialised serum created by VerTech, certain warriors who passed the Dragonslayer trials would consume this serum, then the magical waters at the waterfall on the isles known as Dragonfall. This allowed these warriors to leap through the air and enhancing their strength, allowing them to impale the dragons with polearms and spears, they could even remain in the air for a time, allowing them to do battle with dragons in the skies, many dragons gave up on this war, believing it to be pointless, but not Níðhöggr (Nidhogghr) and his brood of black dragons, who continued this war for many years until during the final battle of the war, Níðhöggr was impaled through his eye by a dragonkiller, and set upon by dragonslayers, Níðhöggr barely clinging to life was forced to retreat, along with his brood, a retreat that they would not recover from, ending the war.</p><br>
        <h3>(568,083 AGC - 583,028 AGC)</h3>
        <h2>A Kingdom Rising</h2>
        <p>While many considered the Asaians to be overly ambitious, they were remarkably unscathed after their war with the dragons, and almost immediately after in the following eras continued to push for more power and authority within the Institute, to varying degrees of success, the current King of Asaia shared his view of their world united, under a single banner, the Kingdom, or rather the Institute as he referred to it then. Every action the Asaians took was at large to fufill this dream of unity, a dream that would not be recognised within many of their lifetimes, but a dream shared among their people none the less, the Nymerians also joined the Institute during this time, as did the Northern city of Northelm, in exchange for VerTech being allowed to build plasma pumping stations on their land, though the amount they could build was restricted, VerTech had finally got their request granted after over 40,000 years. These new pumps greatly reduced the cost of plasma overall on a global scale, leading to more prosperity for the world as a whole.</p><br>
        <h3>(583,028 AGC - 602,584 AGC)</h3>
        <h2>Asaia Ad Infinitum</h2>
        <p>By far one of the most important eras in history that still pertains to current day, this would be the era in which Asaia would propose a great reform of the Institute, converting it from an Institute of individual nations focused on further progressing technology and benefiting the globe as a whole, to a Kingdom, one centered around their nation of Asaia, with them governing all others. Likely seeing the writing on the wall, the Osirians and Shailans were quick to agree, as were the VerTech ambassadors, the company which had earned a place within the Institute sometime during the previous era.<br><br>Northelm and Nymeria, their capital which had begun to be called the Night City, rejected this proposal outright, with the North not wishing to be ruled over by another region and the people of the Night City holding particular distain for the Asaian people after their long history of mistrust, hostility and war. Asaia already having the power to do so, ejected these two from the Institute, and thus the vote passed, with the Institute turning into the Kingdom, this would then begin a long campaign of Asaia bringing the others who rejected this notion, even those not in the Institute, to heel.<br><br>They began a 500 year war with the North, and while they fought as best they could, they didn't truly have the military might or technological power to challenge this new Kingdom, with their capital being bombarded until the Northern people submitted to the rule of this new Kingdom. VerTech had also completed prototype plasma-based weaponry which the Kingdom would use to great effect in bringing the nation of Nymeria to heel as well, this battle lasting far less time than their previous war, with the Nymerians being completely outclassed by the Kingdom, with the Kingdom stating their intention to bomb the nightwell until it was reduced to nothing should they refuse to submit, rather than letting his people be slaughtered and the Nightwell reduced to rubble, their Night King surrendered. The remaining part of the era was spent quelling and bringing smaller nations into the fold, but by the end of the era, the planet was unified as one Kingdom.</p><br>
