      <h2>Asaia Isles</h2><p>Asaia Isles are possibly the most well known region in the Kingdom. It is within this region that the royal family rule over the entirety of the Verdian people, and the entire Kingdom at large. The isles themselves are famed for their beauty and tranquility. The isles themselves seem to be so much more alive than other regions, magic pulsating from every stone, flowing in every current, fitting for the place that is considered to be the birthplace of Veridian Magic. When the world was whole, most of Verdial used to look similar to what the isles does now, tropical forests and jungles across the entire planet, however with the sundering this is now no longer the case.<br><br>As the most populated region in Verdial, the isles serve as a hub for commerce and trade, it is also more likely to recieve tourists than the other regions. The natives to this region are the Asaians, the Wardens and the Dragons, though the latter two have dwindled in number significantly since Asaia's rise to power.</p><br>
      <h2>Nymeria</h2><p>Nymeria is well known, but not for the fact it is a popular tourist spot or a trade hub, but because of the fact that very little is actually known about Nymeria, their isolationist policies make it hard for any outsiders to really understand their people or their culture. All that is really known about their land is they have a religion of sorts centered around a mysterious source of power known as the Nightwell, this Nightwell warps and alters the land around it, and so it has also overtime altered the people of Nymeria. The Nightwell is known for its anti-magic properties, and as such so is the region of Nymeria, it's flora, and by extension its people. While they are isolationist in nature they do actually allow tourists and visitors, it's just very rare for any to actually choose to visit Nymeria over the other regions on offer. Natives to this region are Nymerians and Dark Elves.</p><br>
      <h2>Shairan</h2><p>Although this region does not officially have a name, most generally tend to refer to it as "Shairan", the region of Shairan is a vast desert, sparsely populated with a few oases scattered around. The capital of this region is Shaotau, a city that has a long and storied history, existing since back in the times of the ancient elven empire. This is also the region VerTech operates out of. The region itself has the largest amount of ruins remaining of the elven empire, leading to it being one of the best regions to visit to see the culture of the elves before their empires collapse. Natives to this region are Shailans and Sand Elves.</p><br>
      <h2>Osira</h2><p>The swamps of Osira are located in the south west part of Verdial, while considered harsh and inhospitable by many, are the source of most of the raw materials used to create the majority of medication and drugs produced, not just by VerTech but by the entirety of Verdial itself. It's also known for having one of the only underwater cities on Verdial, that being Osiris itself. Natives to this region are the Osirians and the Swamp Elves.</p><br>
      <h2>Northern Wastes</h2><p>The Northern Wastes is an inhospitable frozen plain located in the northern part of Verdial, even more sparsely populated than the Shairan Desert, this is due to the constant below zero temperatures, savage wildlife and lack of any sort of sun in order to grow and harvest crops. The capital of this region is Northhelm, but calling it a capital would be quite generous given the lack of population. There are a few more villages scattered around the coasts but not much more than that. As you might imagine there are very few visitors to this region due to it's inhospitable nature, with the very few who dare to enter this region being hunters in search of more dangerous prey. Natives to this land are the Northern Verdians, the Snow Elves, the giants and the half-giants.</p><br>
      <h2>Sultan</h2><p>Sultan used to be the name of the capital that existed on the southern continent, however with this capitals collapse, the entire region itself became known as Sultan instead. There is no capital on this region, and the climate itself can be considered a mix of the Asaia Isles and Shairan. The lands would be quite nice, if not for the tribalist nature of it's inhabitants. While they are kept in line by the Kingdom, it still wouldn't be a particularly safe area to visit, compared to the other regions on offer, eclipsed only by the Northern Wastes, perhaps. Natives to this region would be the Sultarins and the Southern Wood Elves who, somewhat perculiarly when it comes to Elves and Verdians, live together, with them essentially as equals, though some minor racism does still persist.</p><br>
      <h2>Shalar</h2><p>The region known as Shalar is simply an island off the coast of the main Asaia Isles. While most consider it to be a part of the isles, it is a distinct region in it's own right. Unlike other Verdians, the people of Shalar were not conquered, but submitted willingly, as such they have far more autonomy than most of the other Verdian regions. This land is similar to that of the rest of the isles in that it is infused with magic, though the magic here would be different, rather than Veridian, it would be Arcane magic that infuses this region. The people of Shalar remained out of contact with the wider Verdian community for some time, as such in the wake of the sundering they developed their own culture, their own traditions and all of these are on display on their island. Natives to this region at the Shalaziri.</p>
