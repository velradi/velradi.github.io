    <h2>The Origins of the Dwarvern Species</h2>
    <p>Much isn't known about early Dwarvern history, however it is known they evolved alongside the other first races during the dawn era, while not as large as the giants or as intelligent as the elves, they were short, and sturdy, far better suited to extended periods of physical labour than any other race. The earliest dwarven settlements were made within caverns and in mountains, given the threat offered from both the proto-beasts and giants, dwarves learnt to draw nutrients from the the stone of the land, while not plentiful, it did offer them enough to survive, inbetween hunting other animals, they discovered many other minerals such as salt, they also began to use various other minerals such as iron in stews for when meat was scarce, it was not until elves began to create weapons that the dwarves also considered doing the same with their stronger minerals.<br><br>Dwarves had already created pickaxes generations before the elves created advanced weaponry, they took many of these ideas from the elves, such as swords, axes, maces and even the idea to use metal in their arrowheads for their bows and arrows. During the time of the elven empire, the elves took many dwarves for slaves in order to mine and build for them, so this led to dwarves constructing a subterranian city with the gnomes, in an effort to remain hidden from the elves, this would be a city that the elves would never find. During the sundering however when the land shifted and broke apart, the cavern that the entire city was based in collapsed, and entombed the entire city, with very few dwarves and gnomes surviving the devestation, the majority of survivors from their race were the slaves of the elves, leading to them having even fewer numbers than elves and aerir in the wake of the sundering, many Dwarves went up into the mountains but some few decided to go underground into caverns, similar to dark elves.</p><br><br>
    <h2>Ironblood Dwarves</h2>
    <p>The last surviving dwarves with the largest population, these dwarves ascended the mountains in the wake of the sundering and made there homes there, carving out mountains to serve as shelter for their homes. These dwarves to this day still have dealings with the Kingdom, providing raw resources such as metals and stone for construction, this being a system of trade between the Verdians and Dwarves that goes back to even the earliest days of the post-sundering world. Ironblood Dwarves are also not an uncommon sight within Asaia, with them being permitted to trade their goods and also live within the lower city. These dwarves possess more ivory skin tones, brown shades of hair and are also known to be somewhat taller than their other dwarven kin.</p>
    <h2>Blackblood Dwarves</h2>
    <p>Named for their charactistic black blood, these dwarves are the survivors who went underground after the sundering, these are the most reclusive of the dwarven peoples, who possess a hatred for any from above ground, especially Verdians and Elves, blaming both of the two races for the destruction of their city and the countless deaths that followed it, being openly hostile to both sides. Fortunately for the two races they seldom leave their underground dwellings, their people surviving on the flesh of subterranian species and the fungi that grow there. It it believed they have had dealings with the Dark Elves when they were both side by side developing heavy weaponry, but it's never been confirmed and seems unlikely that any alliances between the two would be long lived, particularly due to their hatred of elves, but both racial variants inhabit the Nymerian Subterrain. They have bluish skin tones, as found on Dark elves and Nymerians, and their hair can vary from shades of black to blue. In more recent times they have signed an agreement with Asaia, allowing VerTech scientists to take samples of fungi from their land, and also promising not to produce further heavy weaponry.</p>
    <h2>Saltblood Dwarves</h2>
    <p>While not as well known as their other dwarven contemparies, these dwarves are nonetheless a variant of the dwarven people. While the Ironbloods took to the mountains, and the Blackbloods took to underground caverns, these dwarves took to the sea, their ancestors battling the great waves as they sailed from place to place, with the land shifting they had no permanent home. That was until the land calmed, they then took up residence on an island within the eastern sea, they started out as raiders, raiding Shairan settlements, until they came to learn about agriculture and livestock, they then took these teachings and established their own farms on their island, they were always an isolationist lot but during the rise of the Kingdom, they entered into an trade agreement with Asaia, trading fish and other Saltblood delicacies with them in return they were allowed to maintain their independance, so long as they did not violate the Kingdom laws, they were considered part of the Kingdom however, just with the ability to operate with a higher autonomy than others, given their willingness to accept the Kingdom. They are recognisable by their paler skin tones, almost like salt in colouration and their shades of hair can vary in colour.</p>
