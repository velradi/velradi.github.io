    <h2>The Origins of the Elven Species</h2>
    <p>The elves came to be during the dawn era, as such they are one of the first races to ever exist upon the planets surface, the elves were born with intelligence, but also extended lifespans, which allowed them to amass great wisdom during their time. The elves spent their early days battling the proto-beasts, and the giants, two forces that had great physical advantages over them, to compensate the elves developed weaponry capable of bringing down these two titanic races, however their most notable part of their history would be their discovery of the lake at the centre of the world, they would name this land Elvira and establish their first few villages there, which would eventually grow to the heart of their empire.<br><br>This thriving empire led to them becoming the dominant species on the planet, calling it Verdial, they dominated the land, using their newly found magics and even longer lifespans to force all others into subservience, and any who would not serve, like the proto-beasts and giants were brought to the brink of extinction. It would not be until much later however that they would discover their hubris in enslaving the races they percieved as lesser.<br><br>When Aerir children were born with magical abilities, they initially attempted to purge these children, but parents who did not wish to see their children dead sent them into hiding, these children would re-emerge and form a group known as the resistance, Elves, Aerir and these gifted children who wished for slavery to come to an end, took up arms and a civil war began among the elves, which led to the sundering of the world, the death of 99% of the Elven population and the fracturing of their people.</p><br>
    <h2>Wood Elf</h2>
    <p>The Wood Elves were the surviving elves who chose to remain on the fractured isles of Elvira, they took to the deep parts of the forests of the isles in order to survive, though they often clashed with the Aerir survivors, even later on into their development, these elves are characterised by their tanned skin tones, brown hair shades and taller statures than other elves. These elves would also take in Aerir who refused to live by the ways of the rest of their kin, their law, the emerald pact, became the foundation of the Wardens, an organisation that both the wood elves and the Aerir who lived with them had a part in forming, though not all wood elves are part of the Wardens, the vast majority are. Some wood elves also inhabit the region known as Sultan, though most are known to be on Asaia.</p>
    <h2>Snow Elf</h2>
    <p>Some of the elves fleeing the destruction of their capital found themselves trapped within the northern wastes, with the continent splitting apart they were pushed further and further north into freezing conditions, many died, with few even surviving the harsh cold, but those that did adapted and grew stronger as a result, the snow elves today are able to endure the sub-zero temperatures of the northern wastes and remain a key part of the region, though these elves are reclusive, like most of their kind, not getting in with other races, even other races of elves. To this day they prove an annoyance to Northelm, who has attempted multiple times to branch out with diplomacy but every response is met with a violent response. They are also known for the formation of the Wolfblood Cult, a group that embraces lycanthopic changes and those who are afflicted by them, forming a small community of sorts, but not all snow elves are part of this group. There are also snow elves that journeyed back to the isles and took refuge in the mountains, with their ability to survive the cold conditions of the wastes, the mountains were an easy adaption by comparison. Snow elves are recognised by their pale white skin tones, resembling snow almost and white shades of hair, they are also known to be shorter than wood elves, but still taller than dark elves and swamp elves.</p>
    <h2>Dark Elf</h2>
    <p>Many who survived the sundering did so on the western part of the planet, the land which would eventually become known as Nymeria, all elves were cast out of the city in a violent uprising, similar to what happened at their capital, and forced to flee into the woods, when the sundering hit, these elves were not prepared, many died and fewer still survived, those that did saw their land undergo a gradual transformation, they fled into the caverns of Nymeria to avoid this, and the savage wildlife that awaited them in the forest, becoming the Dark Elves overtime, this group of elves are considered the most numerous, given their uninterrupted expanse beneath the lands of Nymeria, but they are seldom seen given the fact few ever travel to the surface. They are somewhat unique in their societal values from other elves, they are led by a matriarcal system which men are subservient and women are within leadership roles. This is a stark contrast to the vast majority of civilisations on the surface, they are believed to have developed these societal differences due to the constant fighting between men that occured within their society, so the females took over. Some Dark Elves have even been seen hiding out within Shairan caverns, though if a wider society like those found in the underground in Nymeria exists within Shairan, its not clear. Dark elves are recognised by their red irises, bluish skin tones and black hair, they are known to be some of the shortest elves remaining, shorter even than the swamp elves. The dark elves have recently signed a non aggression pact with the Kingdom, even allowing approved individuals safe passage within their lands.</p>
    <h2>Swamp Elf</h2>
    <p>Commonly, these elves are degradingly referred to as the 'bog elves' by both their own kind and other races. These survivors were elves who were within the south-western part of the land when the sundering hit, they found their lush forests give way to flooding, and overtime the land as they once knew it developed into a swamp, but like other elven survivors, they adapted to their new circumstances and now live within the swamps, they are incredibly resistant to toxins, but they are also the least reclusive of the elven peoples, trading with the people who became Osirians on many different occasions, while they will still not tolerate unauthorised visits into their lands, they are by far the most accepting of other races, unlike other elven variants that can usually be found within two or more continents, the Swamp Elves are not found anywhere other than within the swamps of Osiris. They are distinguishable by their greenish skin, light brown shades of hair and their short stature, being the second most short elves, eclipsed only by Dark Elves.</p>
