    <h2>General Overview</h2>
    <p>Veridian Magic is a widely known magic within Verdial, though the rest of the Kingdom mainly consider it a myth given how few people can actually harness it. This is largely because it is a gift from the gods, only bestowed upon those of their choosing. The main users of this magic is Priestesses, Warriors and Valkyries, it is known as lesser divine magic, capable of performing miraculous feats but not to the level of actual divine magic. This magic is also entirely reliant on retaining the gods favour, though there are some exceptions like ascended warriors and valkyries, these two gain an innate command over it and although falling out of favour with the gods will diminish their power it will never fully deplete it.</p><br>
    <h2>Usages</h2>
    <p>The usages of Veridian magic can vary from user to user, though its primary usages are often within the art of healing, though given how versatile the magic is, it can be used for almost anything, the wielders able to conjure objects from thin air, manipulate the elements and reality itself, warp and dominate the minds of others and even empower the user physically and mentally.</p><br>
    <h2>Connection to the Gods</h2>
    <p>As mentioned before this magic is a gift from the gods and due to this finds its origins with them. Created so that they might bestow their most devoted, and their mortal soldiers with a power to combat the demons and their corruption. But it also exists to heal their followers via the priestesses in a temple, this further encouraging the conversion of more believers and worshippers to the Pantheon of the Gods and thus increasing their power</p>
    <h2>Orders</h2>
    <p>While rarely seen, there are orders based around those who gain the gift of Veridian Magic. The Hand of Creation itself is the primary order that deals with Veridian Magic and those blessed with it, the Warriors and Valkyries are one such order under them, but those blessed with the magic must also be blessed with the increased physical prowess, otherwise they will be considered ineligible. Another order is the Acolytes who train to become priests and priestesses, if blessed with Veridian Magic but not meeting the stringent recruitment requirements of the Warriors and Valkyries, those blessed with the magic can undergo acolyte training and join the Hand of Creation that way. If a person chooses to take no path and instead simply live a normal life, their magic will eventually fade given it was already on loan from the gods and if someone chooses to do nothing with the gift they will happily revoke it.</p>
