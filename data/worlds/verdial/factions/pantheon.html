<h2>General Overview</h2>
<p>The Pantheon of Gods are a collective of deities that rule over the mortal realms with divine authority, from the Realms of the Gods. Responsible for the creation of all the existing races within the realms, and it's defense against the demonic hordes that threaten them. While this collective of gods is diverse and have differing opinions, they have never wavered from their role in the defense of their creations. The gods are descendants of the Titans, the original beings that gave their lives to bring the realms, and the gods, into existence, these gods then also had children which led to even more gods. The gods are empowered, and sustained, by the worship of their mortal creations, the more that worship and believe in them, the stronger they are.</p>
<h3>Chivian</h3>
<p>The Chivian God, or as he's simply known, God, is one of the first gods to come into existence. Created by the Titan Divinity, he is among one of the more unique pantheons given he is the sole deity in his pantheon, which is not common among the other pantheons. He presides over the realm of heaven, found within the realms of gods, from here he commands his divine creations, known as Angels, he sends these angels in his stead when dealing with followers, or in matters of combat, with these being three types of angels. The standard type is simply the angel, while more specalised ones exist such as the messengers, who deliver divine commandments and spread the word of god among his followers, and the Archangels, which serve as leaders of the angels, echoing gods will to the rest of the angels.</p><br>
<h3>Narvon</h3>
<h3>Aesir</h3>
<p>The Narvon Aesir gods, or nordic aesir gods, are some of the chief deities within the Pantheon. Having a high level of influence within the council. Their chief deity is Odin, directly created by the Titan Borr, after his sacrifice to create the realms. Odin went on to have sons, most well known among them are Baldr, Thor and Loki, who serve as gods of the pantheon too. The Narvon gods, like other gods, live within the realms of the gods and call the realm of Asgard, their home, at the highest peak of Asgard is Valhalla, a place where those who die in battle, in the name of one of the Narvon aesir gods go, they are then transformed into Einherjar, there they feast, drink and celebrate, waiting for the days of Ragnarok, where they will fight their greatest battle yet. Others who die, not in battle, but still under the belief of the Narvon aesir gods are not granted Valhalla, but are instead permitted to live within Asgard. As such the Aesir gods are considered gods of war and battle.</p>

<h3>Vanir</h3>
<p>Standing in contrast to the Narvon Aersir gods, are the Narvon Vanir gods, while not as prevelant in matters of governance, are still notable. Their chief deity is Freyja, the goddess of fertility and love, she is also twin to the god Freyr, she also went on to have two daughters who are currently classed among the Vanir goddesses, Hnoss and Gersemi. The Vanir gods are considered the gods of agriculture, health and prosperity. They are most commonly worshipped by farmers, fishers and those who pratice witchcraft. The Vanir are known for their magic, being able to cast spells that far eclipse what most of the Aesir can do, while all Narvon gods can call upon divine power, it is not as versatile as the Vanir magics. Those who die and believe in the Narvon Vanir gods go to a meadow ruled over by Freyja called Fólkvangr, where they may live in peace, harvesting, growing and living together with each other in harmony. Their chief deity, Freyja was created by the Titan Njörðr.</p>
