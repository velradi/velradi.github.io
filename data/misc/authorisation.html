    <p style="text-align: center;">(AUTHORISATION LEVEL: R)</p>
    <p style="text-align: center;">The Societal Hierarchy of Authorisation</p>
    
    <p>Regardless if aware of it or not, the people of Etchfield are divided up into levels of authorisation, this determines which documents and reading material that are accessible to that specific person. Most are unaware but for those that are, there wouldn't be any concievable proof that they could access regardless.<p/>
    
    
    <p>V - The highest of authorisation, this references the Lord-Protector himself, whoever holds this rank, shall also hold this level of authorisation. This supercedes all other levels of Authorisation, meaning that the Lord-Protector may look upon any document of any authorisation within Etchfield.</p>
    
    <p>R - While below the Lord-Protector, this is the authorisation level for the Leader of one of the ruling three families, and their firstborn child, as such this is the level required to even read this document.</p>
    
    <p>X - The authorisation level for the entirety of the ruling families, unlike R it does not have restrictions on who in the ruling family is considered to be this level.</p>
    
    <p>Z - This level specifies government documents, so due to this only those of this rank and above will be able to access these documents, those who are considered this rank would be government officials.</p>
    
    <p>W - A unique authorisation level that specifies the wardens, unlike other authorisations, only those with Authorisation W will be able to see W authorisation documents, all others except the Lord-Protector himself will be unable to access these documents, even those of superior levels to authorisation W, with the only exception being if you are of a higher level, and a warden.</p>
    
    <p>G - A unique authorisation level that specifies the glaives, unlike other authorisations, only those with Authorisation G will be able to see G authorisation documents, all others except the Lord-Protector himself will be unable to access these documents, even those of superior levels to authorisation G, with the only exception being if you are of a higher level, and a glaive.</p>
    
    
    
   <p> E - The most standard and basic authorisation level, all citizens of Etchfield are included in this level.</p>
