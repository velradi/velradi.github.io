    <h2>General Overview</h2>
    <p>Arcane Magic, officially known as Aethereal Magic, derives its origins from the Aethereals that exist outside of the realms. This magic can be harnessed by anyone so long as a leyline is nearby and given how numerous the leylines that the Aethereals have unleashed upon the realms are. Arcane magic grants the ability to warp reality and command the elements, there are also higher levels of powers that the most experienced users can access such as time magic, though usages of this are heavily policed by the Timewalkers.</p><br>
    <h2>Orders</h2>
    <p>As this magic can be harnessed by anyone, there are specific orders devoted to its study and practice. While anyone can practice it and interact with it, only certain people can actually harness it to any noticable degree required for actual spellcasting, so like other magics, a level of natural skill or gift with the magic is required. The order of the Sorceresses and Sorcerers that are trained at the magical school of Saitir only take the most gifted of students, a person to get accepted here must be have a high aptitude for the magic. The Magus school of Shalazir is another order, they do not have such stringent entry qualifications and as such not even a degree of natural skill with the magic is required, but given they study to understand and harness the magic, it could take hundreds of years for one who is not naturally gifted to even master the basics of arcane magic.</p>
