    <h2>A Brief Overview of the Kingdom of Verdial</h2>
<p>The Kingdom of Verdial was a Kingdom that once spanned the stars, it consisted of a myriad of planets, with the governing body, centered around the planet Verdial, located within the Infinitum sector. The Kingdom of Verdial served as the government for all member worlds, this entire section of space was referred to as Kingdom space, all of these member worlds would be subject to universal laws and regulations, then each planet would also get their own specific laws, once the culture of this world was analysed. A rather contentious law among many more progressive kingdom member worlds is the legalisation of slavery, while not all worlds practice it, itâ€™s highly profitable trade for many worlds, especially those lacking in tradable goods, so they would be foolish not to use it.
</p>

<p>Membership was not enforced, however not being part of the Kingdom would come with inherent disadvantages, such as the inability to trade upon the galactic market, a trade hub that linked most of the galaxy together, and with the inability to trade with other planets in your sector, your planets economy would be stagnant, crippled, its for this reason that most sectors tended to all join at once, to ensure that their planets would not suffer without the lack of galactic market, some holdouts did still exist however but these were few and far between.</p>

<p>The Kingdom was ruled by the royal family of Eradir, an Asaian family that saw the rise of the Kingdom from a planetary government to a galactic government. Blessed with divine authority and heritage from the Pantheon of Gods, the gods who were responsible for the creation of all the realms.</p>

<p>The Kingdom is divided up into sectors, each sector is managed by a council which is made up of Asaian nobility with a noble being appointed to each planet in the sector, these councils enforce laws, protect the sector and uphold a standard of living for their sector, they also manage trade and ensure that each planet within their sector offers tribute to the Kingdom as scheduled. All of these councils report to sector group council which then report to the high council, the high council then report to the king, the reason for so many councils is due to the thousands of worlds within the Kingdom.</p>
