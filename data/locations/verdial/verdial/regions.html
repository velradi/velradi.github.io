Asaia (City)</p></font><p>While the city of Asaia does share its name with the rest of the isles, it is distinct from the rest of the isles however, the city of Asaia is the capital of Verdial and the seat of power of the royal family of Eradir and for the entire Kingdom itself.</p>

    <p><div style="padding-bottom: 20px; padding-top: 20px;"><b><font size = "4"><p style="text-align: center;">Druid</p></font><p>Druids and druidesses are a part of the wardens and wield the power of nature by making a pact with the planet itself known as the Green pact, they have no magic of their own and are entirely reliant on the planet agreeing with their usage of it and they may lose their powers at a moments notice.</p>

    <p><div style="padding-bottom: 20px; padding-top: 20px;"><b><font size = "4"><p style="text-align: center;">Sorceress</p></font><p>Sorceresses are females that are born with innate magic powers known as Veridian magic, or sorcery, they used to be close to the druidesses and were originally taught how to control their powers by them but overtime a series of events led to a schism between the two groups, while druidesses represent the old ways and rejecting progress the sorceresses embrace progress and civilisation. Sorceresses are the only spellcasters on Verdial to utilise Veridian magic due to you having to be born with Veridian magic to utilise it, druidesses harness nature directly but are inherently more restricted than sorceresses due to them not being allowed to possess too much power whereas a sorceress is essentially limitless. Sorceresses are usually born to specific noble bloodlines which leads to bloodlines being important in Asaia, male sorceresses, known as sorcerers, are sometimes born but are usually much weaker than the females and are not allowed into Saitir. Veridian magic for sorceresses is instinctual due to their innate nature, sorceresses power level depends on the strength of their bloodline with them varying wildly in their potential.</p>

    <p><div style="padding-bottom: 20px; padding-top: 20px;"><b><font size = "4"><p style="text-align: center;">Magus</p></font><p>The Magus’s are a group originating from the Shalazir isles, they, like druidesses, are not born with innate magic, nor do they make a pact of any kind for their power, instead they study and wield the power known as arcane, the magic while complex and hard to understand can be learned, Verdians are not born with any innate talent for this magic however due to it being a magic that isn’t heavily associated with their people, however certain races of Verdians such as Asaians or Shalarians are capable of learning and understanding it easier than for example Northerners or Nymerians. There are usually more male magus’s than female, they stand as a stark contrast to the other magic users of the isles given the others dominant female population.</p>

    <p><div style="padding-bottom: 20px; padding-top: 20px;"><b><font size = "4"><p style="text-align: center;">Saitir</p></font><p>Saitir is the magical school within Asaia that has existed for almost as long as the cities founding, the city admits and teaches sorceresses how to control their power, it also serves as a source of inspiration for young sorceresses to find ideas and ways to harness their powers. It acts as a replacement for traditional schools, since it teaches not only magical control but also all the subjects found in a common Asaian school, however in Saitir they have dorms for students to live in since students are required to live within the school while undergoing education as to prevent their power from going out of control outside of the school as most uncontrolled magical surges happen during sleep.</p>

    <p><div style="padding-bottom: 20px; padding-top: 20px;"><b><font size = "4"><p style="text-align: center;">The Hand of Creation</p></font><p>The Hand of Creation are a sort of religious organisation that provide the majority of the funding and own the majority of temples on Verdial, dedicated to worshipping the pantheon of the gods. They also have a school similar to Saitir where they specialise in training those gifted with the gods powers, specially warriors and priestesses.</p>

    <p><div style="padding-bottom: 20px; padding-top: 20px;"><b><font size = "4"><p style="text-align: center;">Warrior</p></font></b>In every generation of a Verdian family there are those that are born blessed by the gods, this functions similarly to bloodlines with magical affinity, with two divinely blessed people creating a divine bloodline where many more of their children and descendants will be born with similar powers, this is why the royal family usually marry those from the priestesses of valkyries due to their ability to produce divinely blessed children, while being blessed by the gods is more common among the upper echelons of families it isn’t a requirement, and many notable warriors come from lower class families, warriors are blessed with immense strength, durability and an enhanced healing factor, they don’t benefit from the divine spellcasting powers that priestesses have so they’re not as useful as religious leaders but their powers make them excellent for being warriors to do battle with the enemies of the gods and of the Kingdom. Warriors can harness very limited and specific divine magic but their control and mastery is nowhere near that of valkyries and acolytes. Notable members of this group include Justin Taran and once also included Versil, the former heir.</p>

    <div style="padding-bottom: 20px; padding-top: 20px;"><b><font size = "4"><p style="text-align: center;">Valkyrie</p></font></b><p>Valkyries are a synergy between the warrior and acolyte paths, they are strong and durable like their warrior brothers but not as much as them, they can also harness divine magic but not to the level of mastery and acolyte can. Valkyries are more combat focused than the acolytes and are only able to be female, much like the warriors are only able to be male. Due to their versatility in combat they can take up a multitude of roles, such as battle healers, a role that warriors are incapable of performing due to their limited magical ability. Valkyries rely a lot more on their powers than warriors but due to this they can enhance their own strength, it is theoretically possible for a Valkyrie to become as strong as a warrior physically by enhancing their strength with divine magic, though this will only be until they tire as they cannot keep this up forever. Many of the queens throughout Asaian history have come from this order, even more so than the priestesses, due to their divine powers making them desirable for producing more blessed children. Notable members of this group are the royal princess Lysela, however Lysela would later end up changing to become an acolyte</p>

    <div style="padding-bottom: 20px; padding-top: 20px;"><b><font size = "4"><p style="text-align: center;">Acolyte</p></font></b><p>Acolytes, otherwise known as priests/priestesses, are a group blessed with the divine powers of the gods, with these powers they can perform miracles such as healing, cleansing and shielding. Though most acolytes are only ever known for their healing capabilities they are also capable of using their divine powers to smite enemies though their offensive capabilities are extremely limited in comparison to a Valkyrie. For this reason most acolytes train to one day become a priest or priestess of a temple and perform healing and blessings on behalf of the gods, though there are more martial priests that serve as temple guards and protect their less martially inclined brothers and sisters from aggressive temple visitors or other threats. Notable members of this order include the royal princess Lysela.</p>

    <div style="padding-bottom: 20px; padding-top: 20px;"><b><font size = "4"><p style="text-align: center;">Glaive</p></font></b><p>Glaives, fully known as the Kingsglaive, are a relatively new order in comparison to the others, publically they would not exist and their existence itself would not be common knowledge to the general kingdom populace, even to Asaians. The role a glaive fulfills is an obscure one but put simply they specalise in infiltration, stealth and assassination, they utilise these talents in combination with their warp sensitivity to hunt and kill the enemies of the kingdom, particuarly those of the ethereal variety.</p>

    <p>While the glaives are technically trained to hunt and kill warp demons, the lack of any incursions from them leads to them serving more as an ethereal demon specalised group. Though this is not the extent of their duties, in the absense of acceptable prey, they may also serve as spies, or assassins for lesser targets, such as during a war or otherwise. They take their orders directly from the throne, and their leader.</p>

    <p> The leader of the glaives is officially the crown prince Asirion Eradir, but given his tendancy to wander it is not often him that gives the orders, Justin Taran serves as leader of the glaives overall, though his sister Sara Taran, often serves as a leader to the female glaives too, when responsibility is left to them.</p>
