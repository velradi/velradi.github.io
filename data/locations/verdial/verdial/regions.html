<h2>Asaia Isles</h2><p>Asaia Isles are possibly the most well known region in the Kingdom. It is within this region that the royal family rule over the entirety of the Verdian people, and the entire Kingdom at large. The isles themselves are famed for their beauty and tranquility. The isles themselves seem to be so much more alive than other regions, magic pulsating from every stone, flowing in every current, fitting for the place that is considered to be the birthplace of Veridian Magic. When the world was whole, most of Verdial used to look similar to what the isles does now, tropical forests and jungles across the entire planet, however with the sundering this is now no longer the case.<br><br>As the most populated region in Verdial, the isles serve as a hub for commerce and trade, it is also more likely to recieve tourists than the other regions. The natives to this region are the Asaians, the Wardens and the Dragons, though the latter two have dwindled in number significantly since Asaia's rise to power.</p>
