        <h2>General Overview</h2>
        <p>All history contained in here is not all he history of the universe, but merely the history that has affected Verdial. BGC stands for Before Golden City, AGC stands for After Golden City.</p><br>
        <h3>(2.8 million BGC - 2. million BGC)</h3>
        <h2>The Dawn Era</h2><p>The Dawn Era was the age where Verdial was first created, then subsequently seeded with lie. Among these races, sentient life was created, these were the wise Elves, the industrious Dwarves and the mighty Giants. These were the first races on the planet, though during the early era this age was heavily in favour of the Giants, with giants and proto-beasts roaming the surface, holding dominance over the land, and this would be the case for many more years,</p><br>
        <h3>(2.2 million BGC - 2 million BGC)</h3>
        <h2>The Solarstorm</h2><p>600,000 years after The Dawn Era, the first disaster came, within their sector the gods and the ether were doing battle above their planet, this battle released energy which struck the surface of the planet, while the atmosphere diffused much of it this event would forever change the future of the planet and the species on it. While this didn't have much of an initial effect on the land it did lead to the deaths of many beings on the planet.</p><br>
        <h3>(2 million BGC - 1.6 million BGC)</h3>
        <h2>The Awakening</h2><p>The infusion of The Solarstorm led to the awakening of the planets world soul earlier than intended, this caused a cataclysm of changes, while not enough to split the land as would come later, eruptions of volcanos, tsunamis and other disasterous events would befall the land, leading to the deaths of hundreds of thousands due to this unintended awakening.</p><br>
        <h3>(1.6 million BGC - 1 million BGC)</h3>
        <h2>Alterations</h2><p>For the next 600,000 years, many of the sentient races underwent drastic changes due to the now present divine energy infused into not just their world but the flora, the animals they hunted and the water they drank. This caused changes in many of them, the Elves began to grow more intelligent, the dwarves grew to be more hardy and enduring and the giants began to give birth to small, malformed creatures that would eventually become known as half-giants.</p><br>
        <h3>(1 million BGC - 650,000 BGC)</h3>
        <h2>Rise of Elvenkind</h2><p>Over this period the elves began to construct new tools, though the dwarves had been constructing tools for generations, these tools had a greater purpose, instead of for mining or hunting. These tools were created to deal with the two main problems befalling the elves. The proto-beasts and the giants. The Proto-beasts had already begun to shrink in size with each generation following The Solarstorm, which made them easier to hunt for anyone who wasn't a giant, and so the elves began to hunt these great beasts, building up settlements and chasing the beasts from their lands. The giants were also hunted by the elves, while the giants were physically strong, the elves new weaponry were able to overcome this significant disadvantage.</p><br>
        <h3>(650,000 BGC - 100,000 BGC)</h3>
        <h2>Birth of an Empire</h2><p>The rise of the elven empire began here. During this age they began to work together, forming what would eventually be known as the Elven Empire. While they still had no official capital they started to begin work on siege weapons, giants had began to construct their own tools of war but it was too late for them, with the siege weapons the giants were permanently routed from the central land of Verdial, and forced to hide in the southern part of Verdial.</p><br>
        <h3>(100,000 BGC - 0 BGC)</h3>
        <h2>Jewel of Verdial</h2><p>In this age the elves continued to unify, pooling their resources together, the site of what would become known as The Golden City, the crown jewel of their empire, while the building took time, the elves would enslave other races, mainly the dwarves and the newly discovered gnomes, believed to be a variant of dwarves with more intellect that splintered from the dwarves back in 850,000 BGC. They chose a lake that contained a vast reseviour of what came to be known as magic, and built the Golden City around it, creating a structure around the lake, this well would become known as The Font of Life.</p><br>
        <h3>(0 BGC - 100,000 AGC)</h3>
        <h2>Expansion</h2><p>With the construction of their capital nearing completion, the elves turned their gaze outwards, to the other territories of Verdial, seeking to expand their influence, and the amount of slaves they had at their disposal. The giants were considered to be too dangerous, a select few were only ever enslaved with the vast majority being killed on sight. During this time they founded cities to the North, East and West, daring not to go too far in either direction however due to the rather inhospitable conditions outside the central region of Verdial. Late into this age they also discovered the Aerir, a race that seems to be a further de-evolution from that of half-giants, this race had just enough strength to be suited for manual labour but not enough strength that they'd be hard to control.</p><br>
        <h3>(100,000 AGC - 300,000 AGC)</h3>
        <h2>Uncontested</h2><p>During this age the elves ruled uncontested, those that wished to live free, like that of the Aerir, had to hide deep in the southern jungles to evade the elves. Giants had become a rare sight, believed to be almost extinct. Dwarves and Gnomes that were not enslaved were rarely ever seen on the surface, believed to have a subterranian city, though no signs of such a city were ever found by the empire.</p><br>
        <h3>(300,000 AGC - 350,000 AGC)</h3>
        <h2>Rise of the Aerir</h2><p>A significant amount of time had passed since the enslavement of the Aerir, while societally shunned, some elves did have relations with the slaves under their control, leading to the birth of unique Aerir which were more physically attractive than that of other Aerir, they were also superior physically, having better strength, speed and endurance, though perhaps most uniquely they had access to the magics that the well provided to the elves, while most of the first of these unique Aerir were unaware of their powers, overtime they would become aware of it, many choosing to hide these powers, though it could not remain a secret forever.</p><br>
        <h3>(350,000 AGC - 355,000 AGC)</h3>
        <h2>Beginning of the End</h2><p>While the elves were unaware of it, the birth of these new Aerir spelled doom for their entire empire, the Emperor clearly realised the threat these newborn Aerir could present, especially now that it was almost common knowledge that these children could utilise the well. These Aerir started to be rounded up and executed, though many parents took precautions to see that their children survived, this would be a crucial turning point in the history of the entire planet.</p><br>
        <h3>(355,000 AGC - 356,500 AGC)</h3>
        <h2>Uprising</h2><p>During this time the Aerir that were born began to in secret learn how to harness their powers, as well as get their hands on weaponry from elven sympathisers, until the later point of the era where a full blown civil war erupted.</p><br>
        <h3>(356,000 - 356,018 AGC)</h3>
        <h2>The Sundering</h2><p>The uprising continued on for 18 years, constant fighting across the city, while the central part of the city was mostly spared from the fighting, uprisings occured all across the outskirts, and in various different territories. This led to a final battle in the year 344,482 AGC, a cataclysmic event known as the sundering occured, the constant battling of both the rebels and the empire caused the well to grow unstable from its use, the elves attempted to sever the connection of the Aerir magic users from the well and this was the final straw, the well detonated, flooding the entire city but having far more disasterous consequences, all over the land shifted and broke apart, cities were swallowed by the earth and the world itself rendered into an unstable and fractured group of continents, with a near constant storm that would persist for 100 years. During this time 99% of all elves died, along with a lot of other races such as giants and non-enhanced Aerir, the subterranian city of the dwarves and gnomes also collapsed during this time, killing all who couldn't make it out of the city before the sundering, a vast majority of the Aerir rebels managed to survive however.</p><br>
        <h3>(356,018 AGC - 356,100 AGC)</h3>
        <h2>A land undone</h2><p>It took approximately 100 years for the storms to subside and the continents to stop being overwhelmed by constant tidal waves and tsunamis, and a further 918 years for the planet to actually become stable enough for civilisation to begin to rebuild, during this time most surviving races lived nomadically, traveling around their continent in order to survive, having to flee before a flood kiled them, or the earth collapsed, and so on.</p><br>
        <h3>(356,100 AGC - 367,000 AGC)</h3>
        <h2>The Rebuilding</h2>
        <p>It took approximately 3,000 years for any sort of substantial rebuilding efforts to be made. Many different events occured during this time such as the Aerir of the isles meeding other Aerir survivors, both on and off the isles. During this time Aerir survivors on the central isles receeded the water that had flooded the city and began to rebuild the destroyed city, having to also deal with elven survivors who wanted their city back. <br><br>The Night City lowered their barrier and the surviving Aerir began to explore their changed land, while also building up outposts. The Aerir survivors of Shairan began to rebuild their ruined city, while also adapting to their change of climate. The Osiria Aerir survivors were dealing with the vast majority of their land still being flooded, making it a swamp now, leading to them living by the coasts and building up villages there. Those within the northern wastes were still dealing with encroaching giants, leaving them little time to rebuild. The majority of the survivors in Sultan were unenhanced Aerir but they still built small villages.<br><br> This is also believed to be the time period when Aerir survivors went to one of the isles and named it Shalar, and build up a small town on there, isolated from the larger community. The people of Shalar would also complete construction of a massive city, using their newly rediscovered arcane magic to both construct and levitate  the city into the sky, founding the magical marvel of a city which would come to be known as Shalazir.</p><br>
        <h3>(367,000 AGC - 400,000 AGC)</h3>
        <h2>The Fires of War</h2><p>This was a period of time where wide-scale wars were once again present. The Aerir that would become known as Nymerians had constructed seafaring vessels and had begun to sail across the seas, raiding and pillaging anything they could. Due to their environment they lacked many things such as various metals, and an abundance of crop harvests which other regions like the isles had in huge amounts. The fighting continued for many years with raids taking place all over the planet. However the most disasterous loss was yet to come.<br><br>The city of Shalazir was impervious during this time, completely unable to be raided due to the inability of the people of Nymeria to reach them, however they had constructed harpoon-like devices that would allow them to utilise their ships to tear the city from the sky, this resulted in the death of almost everyone within the city, with the city breaking apart and falling underneath the waves.<br><br> This act of heinous destruction would ultimately lead to a combined effort of all the other Aerir survivors to attack the people of Nymeria, with the Aerir of the isles having constructed their own ships, this battle led to the destruction of almost all of the navel presence of Nymeria and the bombardment from cannons on the city reducing their city to a ruin, they were then left to the ruins of their society, with any Nymerian ships from this point onward being attacked and destroyed on sight.</p><br>
        <h3>(400,000 AGC - 484,500 AGC)</h3>
        <h2>The Unification</h2>
        <p>This was a time of unification for most of the Aerir surivors, they had come together to form a unified world government, which they called the Verdian Institute. Each region, each region would have a council member appointed to it, with the only exception being that of the Nymerian Aerir, who were not invited to join this new global initiative.<br><br> They also jointly decided their race, instead of being known as Aerir, which is the elven word for slave, would call themselves Verdians, and each region would choose a name for their specific set of Verdians. So were the monikers we know today as Asaian, Shalaziri, Osirian, Shailan and so on, the Aerir of Nymeria chose the name of Nymerian for their people, refusing to allow this Institute to grant them a name not of their choosing. The rest of this time was mainly spent with the newborn Institute finding its footing as a new government.</p><br>
        <h3>(484,500 AGC - 515,000)</h3>
        <h2>Foundations</h2>
        <p>This time was spent with much of the technological development that would still be seen throughout Verdial today, including the spire, the plasma stations and much of the overall powergrid. VerTech was, naturally, instrumental in this era, and cemented themselves as crucial, not only to Verdial but to all of the Kingdom, their efforts in this time is why they are still so prevelant today.<br><br> Many other technological innovations occured during this time, the first plasma core was constructed and allowed for the Verdians to send the first ships into space, in greater number and greater frequency this time than the rocket technology they had been using before.</p>
