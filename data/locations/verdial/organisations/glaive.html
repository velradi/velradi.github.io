        <h2>General Overview</h2>
        <p>The Kingsglaive, otherwise known as Glaives, are the shadowy secretive organisation that isn't even known to exist by the general populace. They take their orders directly from the King himself and the royal family. The Glaives are a recently new organisation, in relation to the rest of the organisations stemming from Asaia, with them being founded in the Rising Tensions Era, their main purpose was to deal with enemies of the throne, by means of assasination, sabotage or misdirection, the means depending on the order given at the time.<br><br>Much of their early history was spent as spies, infiltrating both enemy and allied nations in order to gather and relay information so that Asaia might better prepare for outside threats, it was directly through them that the alchemical testing of Sultan even became known to Asaia. Over the course of the wars that Asaia engaged in they became the premier assassins of the throne, taking out enemy commanders and leaders to throw their war effort into dissaray.<br><br>In modern day they still continue to serve in this role, however they've also taken on a new role, as the people the throne sends to deal with ethereal outbreaks or disruption within a populace, rather than sending the brutish warriors or their fleets to level the population, they instead send the glaives to swiftly and silently dispatch the afflicted, with them able to undertake such tasks so efficiently that none even know that the glaives were there.</p>
        <br><h2>Kingsglaive Divisions</h2>
        <p>The Kingsglaive are divided up into divisions so that their organisation might better operate and handle multiple tasks, members from each division undertake a particular set of tasks, rarely deviating unless in extreme circumstances, such as the Kingdom being at war.</p>
        <h3>Shadows</h3>
        <p>The first of the Kingsglaive's divisions are the aptly named Shadows, serving as experts in both infiltration and assassination, these are the people the Glaives send to assassinate targets, be they lowborn civilian or a high ranking military commander, these are the ones that handle it all, however assassination is not the only thing they do, as mentioned before infiltration often comes with assassination but sometimes it is merely infiltration that is needed, and they will also serve in this role, whether it be planting a bug, sabotaging systems or even hacking, the shadows also undertake these responsibilities too.</p>
        <h3>Ravens</h3>
        <p>The Ravens are the spies of the Glaives, having the skills of seduction, communication, observation and deception. While all Glaives are trained in combat, the Ravens are the ones that place the least empthasis on it, preferring to avoid combat entirely through manipulation of any given situation, these silver-tongued savants are capable of turning any situation to their advantage, as well as avoiding detection in the process, though the difficulty of the position varies from assignment to assignment, but this division sees the least combat out of any of them, though perhaps not including Blackwall.</p>
        <h3>Blackwall</h3>
        <p>The Blackwall division are the ones that focus on combatting threats to the Kingdom's defense, they do this via technology. This division operates out of their headquarters, and are linked in to all Kingdom systems, able to access and monitor any device at any moment, with the exception being that of the royal family, unless authorisation is given by the King. Through this they are able to predict attacks before they even happen from dissidents or outside threats. They spend most of their time at a computer, rarely venturing outside of the HQ unless required, they have the authorisation to subvert all other authority in matters of technology, with the only exception being royal authority, and VerTech core system access.</p>
        <h3>Veilguard</h3>
        <p>Known simply as The Veilguard, these glaives exist to do one thing, fight, excelling at it, they are always the first ones sent in when an ethereal outbreak occurs, or when the glaives are required for war. Their main purpose is to ensure no threats endanger the realms, and by proxy the Kingdom, while the Veilguard of course recieve full Glaive training, and have the skills that other glaive divisions possess, their primary focus throughout their training is combat.</p>
