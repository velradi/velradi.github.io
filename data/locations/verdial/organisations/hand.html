        <h2>General Overview</h2>
        <p>The Hand of Creation is an organisation thats founding dates back to the earliest times of Verdian society, for as long as the written language has existed the Hand of Creation has also. They primarily exist as the organisation to record the teachings, lessons and words of the gods, then distributing this to the Kingdom entire to allow all races to know the will of their creators. Their seat of power is within Asaia on the planet Verdial, however they have many temples scattered throughout the Kingdom on a multitude of worlds where those who wish to worship the gods or speak to a priest about their faith may do so. The Hand of Creaton recognises all gods found within the Pantheon of Gods, and worship to any of the gods in that pantheon are permitted, and encouraged, within their temples.</p>

        <h2>Warriors</h2>
        <p>Enforcers of the divine will of the gods, while most might think of the Hand of Creation as a priesthood and little else, this could not be further from the truth, as is evident by the warriors here. The Warriors are, specifically Verdian, individuals that are blessed by the gods at birth with many physical gifts, including increased strength, speed, stamina and much more. These individuals are sort out by the Hand of Creation and taken to the main temple within Asaia to be trained as Warriors, as they continue their training they will learn how to harness the divine powers gifted to them by the gods, as they work towards what all warriors desire, ascension. The Warriors serve as a military force, assisting the wider Kingdom Military in war, but they exist solely to oppose all enemies of the gods, be they part of the Kingdom or not.</p><br>
        <h3>Conduit</h3>
        <p>Within the Warriors there is a unique trait that sets one warrior apart from another, while all warriors are blessed at birth with increased physical performance there are those that stand out from the others, these individuals are specifically chosen by a god or goddess within the pantheon to serve as the conduit for their power. These warriors without training possess a level of physical performance not seen in ordinary warriors, making them pretty easy to spot straight away, though overtime as they train their powers will manifest if not spotted before, though usually the gods send word of the name of their conduit to the hand of creation so they might seek them out, along with other warriors, once a conduit is identified they are led through the Ritual of Awakening, this ritual will link both god and conduit and from this moment forth, the conduit will be capable of channeling the power of their god. When one conduit dies, another is immediately elevated to the position, either from the ranks of the warriors or an undiscovered warrior candidate. The status of conduit can be passed from parent to child, given the higher chance a god will choose the offspring of their current conduit than a new conduit entirely.</p>
        <h3>Divisions</h3>
        <p>Warriors, once trained and ascended, are divided up into divisions, while the Lord-Warrior holds command over all warriors, there is a Captain in command of each squad that relays the Lord-Warrior's orders, though the Lord-Warrior is capable of leading their own squad too, as is usually the case. There are many recognised divisions within the warriors, the most notable, and well known to the public, of these being Lord-Warrior Asirion Eradir's Immortal Division and Justin Taran's Seeker Division, given the friendship between these two leaders, their squads often work in tandem with one another. Though there are many other divisions within the warriors.</p>
        <h3>Immortals</h3>
        <p>As stated above, most if not all of the citizens within Asaia have heard tale of the legendary Immortal division, it is often the division most who train as warriors strive for, and with good reason. The Immortals have a reputation for being the best of the best, the elite if you will, whenever there is a great battle, the Immortals will be in the thick of it, cutting down enemies left and right, true to their name they have some of the lowest fatality rates of any division within the warriors, meaning spots rarely open up within this division, and if they do they'll be a highly contested commodity, as only the best are even considered for a spot. Those within this Division are characterised as being strong, indominable, physically dominant and alltogether unkillable.</p>
        <h3>Seekers</h3>
        <p>While not as prestigious as the Immortals, the Seekers are still the second most popular and well known division within the warriors and while most might strive to become an immortal, the seekers attract a certain type of individual, the invividual who enjoys dueling, it is within this niché that these warriors find their home, given their Captain's love of dueling, it is what they strive for perfection in, while immortals often see themselves as above dueling, preferring to harness their skills only when they wish to kill their opponent. Those within this Division are characterised as being skilled, inquisitive and performers, who often have a taste for flair in their combat.</p><br>

        <h2>Valkyries</h2>
        <p>Within the Hand of Creation exists a female variant of the warriors, though they do possess distinct differences which warranted their seperate order. While the Warriors are blessed with physical strength, Valkyries are instead blessed with a greater command over divine powers, allowing them to perform more intricate and advanced techniques that would elude warriors. Valkyries for this reason often serve as a supporting force to warriors on the field, being particularly adept battle-healers, though they are capable as serving as actual combatants in their own right.</p>
        <h3>Conduit</h3>
        <p>Much like the warriors, Valkyries are also capable of being blessed as conduits, though they are usually specifically singled out by the goddesses instead of the gods. The same is true of warriors with gods preferring them as conduits as opposed to goddesses. The status of conduit can be passed from parent to child, given the higher chance a goddess will choose the offspring of their current conduit than a new conduit entirely.</p>
        <h3>Divisions</h3>
        <p>Much like the Warriors, the Valkyries also have their own divisions, with the Lady-Valkyrie overseeing them all, but each division's captain relaying her orders. The most prolific and well known Valkyrie divisions are the Luminary division, led by the Lady-Valkyrie Sara Taran herself and the Harbinger division.</p>
        <h3>Luminary</h3>
        <p>As stated above, most, if not all, citizens within Asaia have heard of the Luminary division, led by Sara Taran, the Lady-Valkyrie. The Luminary division is the division that is most well known for their adeptness at divine magic, particularly in the healing arts, which is viewed as what all Valkyries should strive towards. For this reason they're often the division most Valkyries hope to attain when they are ascended, but given their low mortality rates, they often are not accepting new candidates, and even if they are they must be the best. Those within this Division are characterised as being inquisitive, gentle and graceful.</p>
        <h3>Harbinger</h3>
        <p>While not as prestigious as the Luminaries, the Harbingers are still the second most popular and a well known division within their own right. The Harbingers specalise more in martial combat than magic, which is considered to be an oddity among the Valkyries but it does help with those who fit this unique niché. They are led by Princess Lysela Eradir, who is often known for her lack of divine skill, on par with those of the warriors. Like the Seekers of the Warriors they have a love of dueling, this also being something inherited from their leader. Those within this division are characterised as being assertive, confident and calm in most situations.</p><br>


        <h2>Acolytes</h2>
        <p>Acolytes serve as trainee priests and priestesses, they do not serve or train in a combat role like Warriors and Valkyries do, instead they are more greatly educated in the faith and teachings of the gods so they might better serve within temples. Acolytes themselves, unlike warriors and valkyries, are born without powers, be they physical or magical, as such it is possible for any to undertake training in the ways of an acolyte, though usually an already established knowledge base of the gods of the pantheon and their teachings will increase your chances of being accepted for acolyte training. Due to the acolytes having no powers, this will persist even when they are fully trained, as the way a priest or priestess functions is they ask the gods for aid and the gods will either accept or refuse to assist on a case by case basis, they usually invoke the gods power for means of healing the sick who come to a temple.</p>
        <h3>Priest</h3>
        <p>Once a male acolyte is fully trained and undergoes their rites, they will be considered a priest and assigned to a temple. Priests are actually somewhat uncommon to be seen, and if they are, they're rarely seen within the majority of temples on Verdial, and they also rarely hold leadership positions within the temples. While there is a Lord-Warrior and Lady-Valkyrie who oversee both the Warriors and Valkyries respectively, the same is not true of the priest and priestesses, both are overseen by the High Priestess, and each temple outside of the main temple in Asaia have a Head Priestess, rather than it being a priest. Most Priests serve in menial roles within the temples, rarely meeting with those who come to the temple, instead they usually serve as archivists, inscribing text and such for the Hand of Creations archives to further their knowledge and teachings of the gods. Unlike Warriors and Valkyries, Priests are not capable of becoming or inheriting the status of conduit.</p>
        <h3>Priestess</h3>
        <p>Once a female acolyte is fully trained and undergoes their rites, they will be considered a priestess and assigned to a temple. Priestesses are much more commonly seen within temples than priests, however priestesses also face a higher bar of entry as a result. Priestesses often have to pass more stringent criteria than their male counterparts, like being physically attractive and being in good health both physically and mentally. This is given their role as healers within temples and the fact they are supposed to represent the beauty and perfection of the pantheon itself and their faith, this is assisted if they live up to the standards set in place by the Hand of Creation. Unlike Warriors and Valkyries, Priestesses are not capable of becoming or inheriting the status of conduit.</p>
