    <h2>The Origins of the Verdian Species</h2>
    <p>Thousands of years ago the elves ruled over the surface of the Kingdom, creating one of the largest and most powerful empires in all of the history of Verdial and retaining power via the use of the  Mystical Well which granted them their magical powers, otherwise known as Arcane Magic. The Verdians were once known as the Aerir, otherwise known as the slave race, they lived short lives, with many of them not living beyond 30 years given their lives spent in servitude, the men served for manual labour and the women served as servants, they would serve as the primary slaves of the elven empire, and would do for many generations.</p>
        
    <p>After around thirty thousand years of servitude, children fathered between elves and their Aerir slaves began to develop innate arcane magical abilities, children that developed these abilities were put to death by the the elves as they threatened their power but some of these slaves hid their children from the slaughter, these events would eventually lead to the slave uprising, after a hundred years of these children appearing and growing up they eventually decided to liberate their people from the elves slavery, assisted by elven sympathisers they led an assault on the golden city, the capital of the elven empire.</p>

    <p>The battling continued for days before the Aerir born with their innate magic attempted to manipulate the well to cut the elves off from it, the elves attempting to stop them destabilised the well, causing the land to split apart, causing the world to no longer be whole and split apart into continents, the elven cities were flooded by the tsunami of water that battered the coasts and the well flooding the golden city, elves no longer being able to use the well given how unstable it now was died, the elves loosing 99% of their population in this sundering, the Aerir themselves fleeing into the woods to survive.</p> 
    
    <p>Over the years the Aerir survivors wandered before deciding to claim the ruins of the golden city, they, with the aid of the gods, used their magic to recede the water and began to rebuild the city, they renamed the city to Asaia and the entire isles around them was also changed to the same name. Overtime the more they resided in Asaia they began to have differences in ideology, some wished to no longer practice magic due to it being associated with the elves, others simply wished to colonise new lands and explore, and so the Aerir people who had begun calling themselves the Verdians, became divided and many of the colonised areas would become the major cities seen today.</p>
    <h2>Asaian</h2>
    <p>Perhaps the most recognisable of the Verdians on a global scale, the Asaians are the face of the Kingdom and their capital of Asaia is the seat of power of the Verdian people, and the once great Golden City of the elven empire. The Asaians are blessed with extended lifespans, increased physical attributes and an innate adeptness for arcane magic is more commonly found in their people. Asaians are most recognisable for their dark hair colours, vibrant irises and tanned skin. They are also among some of the tallest of the Verdian species, eclipsed only by the Northerners.</p>
    <br><h2>Nymerian</h2><p>Nymerians are usually the most distinct and recognisable Verdian subraces, this is mostly due to their shades of blue and purple skin, unnatural hair colours and shimmering moonlit irises. Nymerians are a product of their environment, once a city within the elven empire dedicated to the study of the mysterious nightwell and how they might harness its power for the empire. The city was caught up in the effects of the sundering, and as the land tore itself apart the Aerir slaves within the city invoked the nightwell, praying to it for salvation. In response the nightwell rose a shield that protected the city as the land was sundered. As time went on the land around them became irrevocably altered by the nightwell and so to did their people. The Nymerians have always been an isolationist sort, given their outwardly strange culture and reverance for the nightwell, they simply prefer to be left alone.</p>
    <br><h2>Osirian</h2><p>Osirians are the subrace of Verdians that inhabit the swamps of the south-west part of Verdial. While little grows in their land they are more known for their technological marvel of a city, a purely underwater city, with the water kept out via a powerful barrier. Some Osirians do still live on the surface, mainly along the coast, but the vast majority live within their underwater city of Osiris, named after their people. They produce a vast amount of the raw materials required for the creation of various drugs, antidotes and healing concotions found within Verdial, leading to them having a rather close relation with VerTech.</p>
    <br><h2>Shailan</h2><p>If Shailan's are known for anything it is the formation of the company VerTech, a staple of Kingdom society. The Shailan people inhabit the deserts found in the eastern part of Verdial. While it would not be a trivial thing for someone to survive here, the Shailan people did not just survive, but thrived. After being cut off entirely from the rest of the Verdian people in the sundering. The Aerir survivors had to deal with their once abundant tropical land transforming into a desert wasteland as they were pushed further east. Overtime they rebuilt what was left of their ruined city, Shaotau, and eventually over the many years that passed they founded VerTech. Today it is what they are most known for and the company itself, while not the governing body of their people, hold considerable sway within said government.</p>
    <br><h2>Northern</h2><p>Known as the Northern Verdians, or most of the time simply shortened to Northerners. These are the Verdians that inhabit the northern part of Verdial, the frozen wastes. Such an uninhabitable land was almost barren during the times of the elven empire, save for the loose collection of giants that inhabited it. During the sundering however when the land shifted, one group of Aerir fled to attempt to escape the destruction. While they did escape said destruction they would find themselves stranded and lost within the frozen wastes, many died during this time but those that survived had to endure more hardships, war with the giants, elves and dwarves. This was not where the start of their subrace actually began however. <br><br>The giants began giving birth to children who were smaller and frailer than they were, they cast these children out, known as half-giants, and they came to find refuge within whatever settlement they could find, mostly Verdian ones. Over the many years that preceded their current distinction as northerners the half-giants and verdians began to interbreed. This led to the creation of the aptly named and recognisable northerners. Now it is the case that there are no Verdians in the north left without half-giant DNA, and as such they are now characterised as being a large, towering and muscular people. The Northerners have a history of being raiders, this has changed in the modern age where they would never succeed in such a task, but back in the ages that predate the modern, this was what they did. To this day the lands of the North are still sparsely populated, with the sole largest city in the wastes, Northhelm, being their capital.</p>
    <br><h2>Sultarin</h2><p>Sultarin is the name for the scattered various amounts of tribes that inhabit the southern landmass of Verdial. While they used to once have a mighty empire, one that could have even rivaled the Asaians, they lost it all due to their own hubris, in an attempt to create supersoldiers, which eventually led to their destruction. Sultarin's are one of the few Verdian subraces that don't have an official capital, and even more unusual is their origins. They are descendants of the Aerir, but the less magically inclined Aerir, indeed there are very few in their tribes that can even use magic, this is due to their ancestors being Aerir that hid from the Elven Empire, hiding within the forests there. They are actually connected to the northern wastes but seperately by a massive mountain, surrounding an area where the giants inhabit. Their climate isn't as similar to the Northerners though, being more similar to that of Asaia. They rarely play a part in the Kingdom however given their tribal nature, those that move to the cities as refugees are the ones that most will see, the ones that remain within the lands of Sultan, named after their once mighty capital, will constantly war with each other, fighting for resources and such, but with Asaia's intervention, wars have become far less common among their people than they once were.</p>
    <br><h2>Shalaziri</h2><p>The Shalaziri are often not considered their own people by outsiders, though this is not quite the case. While they do inhabit the same isles as Asaia, and are within their land, they are given a high amount of autonomy and self-governance, so long as they maintain the core laws of the Kingdom and don't impede the Asaians in any way. They are most well known for their city, Shalazir, otherwise known as the Magus capital, this due to the fact this city is where those that wish for a magical education come to train, wishing to join the ranks of the Magus'. They have quite a different culture from Asaia, and their appearances are also quite different to them too, in stark contrast to the tanned Asaians, Shalaziri due to their magically altered city, rarely experience such things like powerful sun rays, culturally pale skin is considered to be the most attractive as it denotes the city dwellers from the ones who work the fields. As such they often have paler shades of skin, darker shades of hair, with most having such dark brown hair it'd be considered black. Their eye colours are also quite uniform, almost all of them having dark brown irises, the only time this ever changes is children born between an Asaian and a Shalaziri.</p>
    <br><br><h2>Descendants of the Verdians</h2><p>As the Verdians are quite an ancient race, they have a fair few descendants, races that stemmed from them. There are the freedom loving Fredians, the warped Solarians and the enigmatic Barsteli. Below will include further details about each race and how they evolved seperately from the Verdians.<p>
    <br><h2>Fredian</h2><p>Perhaps the best known variant of the Verdian race is the Fredians, though over the years Verdial and the Kingdom as a whole have done their best to distance themselves from the Fredians and bury any such information related to their connection to the Fredians as ancestors, as such this information would not exactly be common knowledge. But regardless of this the Fredians are well known in their own right. Fredians have their own sector of space which they call 'free space', and their capital, a ship that was overtime converted into a space station and added to in order to create the capital of their people, Freeholt.
