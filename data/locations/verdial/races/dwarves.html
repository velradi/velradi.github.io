    <h2>The Origins of the Dwarvern Species</h2>
    <p>Much isn't known about early Dwarvern history, however it is known they evolved alongside the other first races during the dawn era, while not as large as the giants or as intelligent as the elves, they were short, and sturdy, far better suited to extended periods of physical labour than any other race. The earliest dwarven settlements were made within caverns and in mountains, given the threat offered from both the proto-beasts and giants, dwarves learnt to draw nutrients from the the stone of the land, while not plentiful, it did offer them enough to survive, inbetween hunting other animals, they discovered many other minerals such as salt, they also began to use various other minerals such as iron in stews for when meat was scarce, it was not until elves began to create weapons that the dwarves also considered doing the same with their stronger minerals. Dwarves had already created pickaxes generations before the elves created advanced weaponry, they took many of these ideas from the elves, such as swords, axes, maces and even the idea to use metal in their arrowheads for their bows and arrows.<br><br></p>
