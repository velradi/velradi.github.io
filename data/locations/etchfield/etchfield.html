<h2>The Doom of Etchfield</h2>
<p>The lands of Etchfield were lost during the year 633 of the King's Calendar or Year 1586 by the Eradir Calendar. This is when the attack orchestrated by the rogue Death Knight, Altherion Vor'el occured, he rose the dead and the sudden unexpected attack was enough to overwhelm Etchfield's defenders, while the battle for Etchfield continued on for a week before Altherion defiled the lands of Etchfield, corrupting the lands of Etchfield and cutting off all those with Etchfield magic, from said magic. This was the final deathblow and the majority of the survivors fled, though some remained, refusing to give up on their land. The Lord-Warrior, Ariean, sacrificed his life to prevent the corruption from spreading beyond Etchfield, but this did nothing to curb the corruption within the land itself. The land still exists however very little to nothing can grow there anymore, and all that is left is ruined buildings. A new chasm has also formed, a fallout from the battle between Vardos and Altherion, those who remain have taken to calling this ravine "Wrath's Fall", as Vardos is believed to have died in this battle.</p><br><br>
