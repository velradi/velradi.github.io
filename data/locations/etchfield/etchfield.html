    <h2>A General Overview of Etchfield</h2>

<p>The Forests of Etchfield are located to the east of the ruins of Gilneas. The forests are sparsly populated and contain very few villages and one major town.The lands of Etchfield are so sparsly populated due to how hostile the land is, everything from savage wild beasts to even a small number of dragons inhabiting its snowy peaks. The lands of Etchfield experience brief summers, long winters and frequent rainfall inbetween it all, sharing much of the climate with their Gilnean neighbours. This area is surrounded by mountains with only a small part of Etchfield connected to the great sea and from land its only accessable by traversing over the mountains of Hillsbrad Foothills, a dangerous trip to be sure but if someone is dedicated enough they can make it to the lands known as Etchfield.</p>

<p>Etchfield is a myth, during the days of Lordaeron there were tales of a civilisation over the mountains, but ever since Lordaeron's collapse, all such records were either destroyed or reclaimed by Etchfield themselves, leaving them as nothing more than a faded memory in a brief period of one of humanities civilisations. Etchfield has long valued it's secrecy, but also it's independance, to which the secrecy as to their existence fuels. While obscure about their location, they are not entirely disconnected from the worlds at large, operating their own private shipping enterprise, they ship and sell goods to many select customers, including many underworld contacts.</p>

<p>Due to the hostile wildlife that awaits anyone that attempts to enter the lands of Etchfield, very few that attempt to make the trip even do so successfully, those that do will either be met with the arrow of a Warden or the blade of a Seeker, if they make it far enough. Such intrusions into Etchfield are rare however, as they maintain powerful wards that makes the lands of Etchfield simply appear as a mountain, and not an actual settled land and even if someone is foolish enough to actually go in search of Etchfield, they will not make it long before suffering the consequences of Etchfield's zero tolerance policy for outsiders.</p>

<p>As mentioned before there are many different towns and villages in Etchfield, and a city which is considered to be the capital of the land. This city is called Asevarn, and it has been under the control of the Eradir family since the founding of Etchfield. The town is located near the central area of Etchfield and serves as a hub for many things, such as local trade, culture and learning. Eredale is another prominent village, settled in the mountaineous regions of Etchfield it is one of the oldest villages in the region and serves as a location the druids of Etchfield are trained, they also produce the highest crop yields in Etchfield, making them crucial for the continued survival of Etchfield. Another town of equal importance to that of Eredale is the town of Taranir it is known for it's trade, both local and between those outside Etchfield as it is the town with the only dock in the region.</p>

<h2>The Doom of Etchfield</h2>
<p>The lands of Etchfield were lost during the year 633 of the King's Calendar or Year 1586 by the Eradir Calendar. This is when the attack orchestrated by the rogue Death Knight, Altherion Vor'el occured, he rose the dead and the sudden unexpected attack was enough to overwhelm Etchfield's defenders, while the battle for Etchfield continued on for a week before Altherion defiled the lands of Etchfield, corrupting the lands of Etchfield and cutting off all those with Etchfield magic, from said magic. This was the final deathblow and the majority of the survivors fled, though some remained, refusing to give up on their land. The Lord-Warrior, Ariean, sacrificed his life to prevent the corruption from spreading beyond Etchfield, but this did nothing to curb the corruption within the land itself. The land still exists however very little to nothing can grow there anymore, and all that is left is ruined buildings. A new chasm has also formed, a fallout from the battle between Vardos and Altherion, those who remain have taken to calling this ravine "Wrath's Fall", as Vardos is believed to have died in this battle.</p><br><br>
