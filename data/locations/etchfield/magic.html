        <h2 style= "text-align: center">Veridian Magic</h2>
        <p>Veridian magic, as the Lord-Protector teaches, is a 'gift from the land', those born within Etchfield have a chance when born to manifest this magic. There are also more direct, and guaranteed, ways to gain this magic, for example, those who become glaives are given access to this magic by the Lord-Protector so that they can fulfil their duties. The magic itself is described as a merger of arcane and nature magic, with users able to do things similar to that of druids and mages.</p>






        <br><br><h2 style= "text-align: center"> Origins of Essence Transference</h2>

<p>The origins of essence transference as we understand it, lies within the Lord-Protector Ariean Eradir himself. Sometime after the sundering, Ariean discovered an artifact that could bestow those with what is known as fluidity, to the essence, Ariean claims his essence already possessed this characteristic, which is not currently known why, it was Cercila Eradir who was the first to use this artifact and then Mirthir Vor'el after her.<p>

<br><h2>On the Subject of Essence Transference</h2><p>Frequent practitioners of the technique have reported a loss of emotional stability, mental clarity and a desensitisation of self. This is more commonly known as <b>the affliction</b> among Etchians and it is believed to affect those who practice it differently and at varying frequency, but it is an inevitability, some are known to be affected more intensely than others currently, such as the Lord-Protector himself, but signs are visible upon others such as Lady Eradir and Lord-Venerate Taran. The Lord-Protector himself seems to have found a way to limit the effects of the affliction but has not deigned to share it with the other practitioners</p>
