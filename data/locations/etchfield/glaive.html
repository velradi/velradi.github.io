    <p style="text-align: center;">AUTHORISATION LEVEL: G</p>
    <h2 style="text-align: center;">An Overview of the Glaives of Etchfield</h2>
    <p>The glaives are one of the most important orders in Etchfield, but despite this they are considered a myth to the general populace, given their absolute secrecy, most would not even know the glaives exist, considering them more of a tale made up to frighten children. The glaives were first established during the times of the Alliance of Lordaeron by Lord-Protector Ariean Eradir as a way to keep an eye on the growing human nations and ensure they did not go against Etchfield interests, the glaives also operated within Etchfield during this time as a way to guard against spies and infiltrators, and also for the Lord-Protector to maintain a watch over his citizens and how they felt about the decisions of The Ruling Three.</p><br>
    <h2>The Glaive Divisions</h2>
    <p>The glaives, otherwise known as Verdial, used to be one singular group but since the reforms of Ariean are now divided into divisons, or sects, in order to better maximise the efficiency and functionality of their order. You can only belong to one of these sects, not multiple. The leadership of one of the sects cannot influence or give commands to another sect that they are not the leader of, this is to prevent many things, such as abuse of power.</p>
        
        
    <br><h3>Shadow Division</h3><p>Led by a Siridal, which is currently Lord-Baron Asirion Vor'el. The more commonly used name for this sect is Ostradis. This sect specalises in the gathering of information outside the region of Etchfield, they also are responsible for the assassination of key targets outside the lands of Etchfield, the reason for these targets being marked for death can vary but regardless it is this division that carries out those contracts.</p>
        
        <h3>Sect Members</h3>
        <ul class="list">
        <li>Asirion Vor'el "Asirion"</li>
        <li>Mirdana Taran "Escant"</li>
        <li>Lysela Eradir "Thalor"</li>
        <li>Orpheus Harond "Kellis"</li>
        <li>Kaleron Fardawn "Jorskal"</li>
        <li>Belaron Nerudis "Xyron"</li>
        
        
    <br><h3>Seeker Division</h3><p>Led by a Siridal, which is currently Lord-Venerate Sorventus Whisperborn. The more commonly used name for this sect is Verdius. The Seeker division serve a role rather similar to that of Wardens, however they specalise in the hunting of people, not beasts. If the wardens ever fail to stop an intruder from entering the lands of Etchfield, it will be the seekers that hunt down and either kill or capture this intruder, or intruders, they also hunt those from the lands of Etchfield themselves, if they have been given a contract for them.</p>
        
        <h3>Sect Members</h3>
        <ul class="list">
        <li>Sorventus Whisperborn "Foridas"</li>
        </ul>
        
        
        <br><h3>Jericho Division</h3><p>Led by a Siridal, which is currently Lady Cercila Taran. The more commonly used name for this sect is Keystone. This division is rather unique among the glaives in it's function, this division sees to the gathering and accumulation of knowledge within the ever expanding libraries in Etchfield. This task usually involves sending the members of the Keystone division out into the world to gather any sort of written knowledge, be they books, scrolls or anything else of the sort, they are then tasked with categorising if such knowledge would be appropriate for the public to consume, if not then an authorisation level is assigned and it is held back from mass view. Another minor role is they specialise in the procurement of any information that could lead people to discovering Etchfield, and ensure that such documents are taken back within the confines of Etchfield to prevent their discovery. Due to the sensitive nature of texts they will be reading and categorising, members of this division meet a rather special loyalty level, far higher than any of the other divisions.</p>
        
        <h3>Sect Members</h3>
        <ul class="list">
        <li>Cercila Taran "Velradi"</li>
        </ul>
        
        <br><h3>Shieldwall Division</h3><p>Led by a Siridal, which is currently Lord-Protector Ariean Eradir. The more commonly used name for this sect is Verdias. This is the oldest division of the glaives, as it was the original one, created by the very same Ariean Eradir thousands of years ago. While this division used to encompass the responsibilities of all the other divisions, given the expansion of duty to other divisions, Shieldwall now functions solely as an information gathering division, meaning that members of this division act as spies within the lands of Etchfield, feeding information back to the glaives, and by extension the Lord-Protector. This is to prevent threats before they happen, but also allows a general overview as to the state of Etchfield for Ariean himself. Due to how known Ariean is he rarely serves in a spy capacity, rather simply letting all the information come to him from it's members, as well as dispatching Shieldwall members where he wishes them to be.</p>

        <li>Cercila Eradir "Verdial"</li>
        </ul><br>

    <h2>The Null Aura</h2><p>An Etchian glaive technique that allows the user to completely reverse the flow of their aura, instead of projecting energy out it will begin to draw energy in, this in effect nullifies their aura, allowing them to be completely undetectable by those that attempt to sense them via such methods.</p>
    <br><h2>Warping</h2><p>A glaive technique born from Etchian Magic that allows the user to quite literally warp, or bend, the space around their body, allowing for them to instantly teleport across short distances(classed as anything within view), while teleporting across long distances and teleporting multiple people is possible with this technique it will drain the user far more than conventional teleportation methods when used in that way. However for short distances, warping will far out class any other teleportation method in both frequency, speed and efficiency.</p>
