      <p style="text-align: center;">(AUTHORISATION LEVEL: R)</p>
      <h2 style="text-align: center;">The Societal Hierarchy of Authorisation</h2>
      
      <p>Regardless if aware of it or not, the people of Etchfield are divided up into levels of authorisation, this determines which documents and reading material that are accessible to that specific person. Most are unaware but for those that are, there wouldn't be any conceivable proof that they could access regardless.</p>
      
      <h3>V</h3>
      <p>The highest of authorisation, this references the Lord-Protector himself, whoever holds this rank, shall also hold this level of authorisation. This supersedes all other levels of Authorisation, meaning that the Lord-Protector may look upon any document of any authorisation within Etchfield.</p>
      
      <h3>R</h3>
      <p>The Leader of one of the ruling three families, while below the Lord-Protector, this is the authorisation level for the Leader of one of the ruling three families, and their firstborn child, as such this is the level required to even read this document.</p>
      
      <h3>E</h3>
      <p>The most standard and basic authorisation level, all citizens of Etchfield are included in this level.</p>
