    <h2 style="text-align: center;">Overview of Etchfield Society</h2>
    <p>The people of Etchfield are often times isolationistic, much like their land, they prefer to be self-sufficient and never wish to rely on outsider help to solve their problems. For this reason, to outsiders they are closed off and openly dismissive but to each other they are family, being related by blood or not does not change how people view each other in Etchfield, considering any native of the lands to be like kin. The only exceptions to this are those that stray from the societal norms and become an outcast. Due to the lands of Etchfield following a hunter-gatherer lifestyle their culture by outsiders could be considered rather brutal and unforgiving, with combat holding a place of high regard in their society.</p><br><br>
    <h2>The Ruling Three<h2>
        <h3 style = "text-align: center">Eradir</h3> <p>The oldest and most prolific of not just the founding families, but all families within Etchfield, given the head of their family is none other than the illustrious Lord-Protector Ariean Eradir himself the original founder, current head of the house is Lord Ariean Eradir. Lord-Protector Eradir stumbled upon this colony purely by chance in it's early days, during the founding he was instrumental in providing his families considerable wealth and knowledge to fund the expansion of Etchfield and see it flourish, as such he became the first Lord-Protector and the only one to hold that role to this day. The Eradir family is unique in the fact there is many different branches of them in Etchfield, there is the Kaldorei branch, closest in blood to the Lord-Protector himself, then the later branch of the Quel'dorei Eradir's that were invited to Etchfield at the Lord-Protector's behest. To this day they hold the most sway out of any family within Etchfield and preside over many different aspects of Etchfield Society. While Kaldorei are still a rare sight within Etchfield, you can almost be guaranteed that if they are a Kaldorei, they are most likely an Eradir. House Eradir oversee the city of Asevarn within Etchfield, this is considered to be the capital of Etchfield by many, given it's economic power within the region.</p>

        <h3 style = "text-align: center">Whisperborn</h3> 
        <p>One of the founding families, current head of the house is Lord- Versil Whisperborn. The Whisperborns stand out somewhat among Etchfield, much like the Kaldorei Eradir's, the Whisperborns are of Kaldorei descent like a portion of the Eradir's and were called to the land of Etchfield early into it's development by a vision their current leader Versil had. It is there that they met the Lord-Protector and were invited to lend their druidic skills to the development of the lands. Today the Whisperborns are a family that oversee the training of Etchfield druids, instructing them in the way of Etchian Magic and how to employ it in ways akin to druids. For this reason their family has earned a place of honour amongst Etchfield, not just for the training of these druids but also for their assistance with ensuring that the Etchfield harvest is always bountiful, even in winters. The Whisperborns have a town in the more mountaineous region of Etchfield, this town is called Eredale and serves as a location where many of the Etchfield Druids were trained, and produces the highest crop yields in the region.
        
        <h3 style ="text-align: center">Taran</h3> <p>One of the founding families, current head of the house is Lord Landris Taran. The were the first human family to be accepted into the ruling families, Taran's have occupied this land long before it was known as Etchfield, indeed many may attribute the fact the colony even exists to their prior efforts, for this reason it was only natural that they would become one of the first founding families of Etchfield. The Taran's oversee much of the more economical side of Etchfield, everything from trading to shipping is often run by the Taran's. Without their human ingenuity and prior experience in both Lordaeron, Gilneas and the kingdoms that existed even before that, Etchfields economy would simply not be able to function, or at least function to the degree it does under the steady hand of the Taran's. For this reason the Taran's have cemented themselves as an important family within Etchfield, and their children and children's children will continue to hold their status for generations to come. The Taran's own the town located on the coast called Taranir, it has become known as the trading town given it has access to the only dock in the region.</p><br><br>
    <h2>Noble Families</h2>
        <h3 style = "text-align: center">Etchyrerry</h3><p>One of the noble families, current head of the house is Lord-Regent Lucius Etchyrerry. Lord-Regent Etchyrerry while not there during the founding of Etchfield, since he came to the land far later, was there when the colony of Etchfield required trade connections to other cities, though these would be underworld contacts, since Etchfield still required and appreciated it's anonymity. He also assisted in providing building techinques that allowed for the construction of more durable buildings, for this reason his line became one of the noble houses, while not a ruling or founding family, they are still a family of prestige within Etchfield. The Etchyrerry family are closely aligned to the Taran family due to the Etchyrerry's having contacts that make it easier to do trade within Alliance affiliated territories, both of these families being the face of trade within Etchfield and as such are known as the trade families of Etchfield. Lord-Regent Etchyrerry also came into posession of a small village, Vsarvik, within Etchfield most recently, elevating him to the title of Lord-Regent.</p>

        <h3 style = "text-align: center">Vor'el</h3><p>A relatively new family name to the lands and not a founding or ruling family, but still one of the noble families, current head of the house is Lord-Baron Aurethan Vor'el. Lord-Baron Vor'el earned this honour by aiding the people of Etchfield against the Laminas threat, he then further displayed his dedication by taking his place as one of the glaives of Etchfield, he also became a warden, a rare thing in the lands of Etchfield to belong to both groups, in doing these acts and proving his dedication to the tenets of Etchfield. The Vor'el family are not really known for much given the small amount of them, with it just being Aurethan himself and his children, fathered with Lysela Eradir, however they take the Eradir name and belong to that household, meaning that for now, the only Vor'el family member recognised as nobility within Etchfield, is Aurethan himself. Though Aurethan individually has become known for his protection of the lands from the savage beasts that would ravage their cities and also his service as a Glaive outside of Etchfield.</p><br><br>
        
    <h2>Nobility Hierarchy within Etchfield</h2>
    <h3>(In order of societal importance)</h3><br>
        <h3 style = "text-align: center">Lord-Protector</h3><p>Ruler of the main city of Etchfield, owns a significant amount of land around it however despite this none are subject to his rules or law unless they live within his land, the rest of Etchfield is left to their own devices.</p>

        <h3 style = "text-align: center">Lord-Regent</h3><p>Rules a smaller town, still under the command of the main ruler of Etchfield, these lords are able to make their own rules and such for their towns but are required to still answer the Lord-Protectors calls to battle and respect them as the leader of the land.</p>

        <h3 style = "text-align: center">Lord-Baron</h3><p>A title that indicates someone owns land in Etchfield, given to the leader of a noble house of Etchfield along with a significant stretch of land, outsiders are able to attain this title like all the others through procurement of considerable wealth or in recognition to their services to Etchfield, or simply just marrying into one of the existing noble families and living long enough to become its leader.

        <h3 style = "text-align: center">Lord-Venerate</h3><p>The eldest trueblooded son of a Lord-Baron or higher, they have a higher standing than ordinary lords but its more of an honourary title than actually one that has any significance in their society, the Lord-Venerate is the one marked as the one to inherit the title of Lord-Baron from their father however after their death.</p>
        <h3 style = "text-align: center">Lord</h3><p>A title thats given to all the male members of a noble family. Lowest in the male tiers of nobility however still a title that marks someone as a noble. It's held by the sons of any of the higher ranks and also can be granted to those by a Lord-Regent or Lord-Protector.</p>

        <h3 style = "text-align: center">Lord-Warrior</h3><p>Lord-Warrior is the title given to the leader of the warriors of Etchfield, it does elevate the warrior to the status of nobility however it is considered below all other ordinary ranks of nobility, except the title of Lady of course.

        <h3 style = "text-align: center">Lord-Seeker</h3><p>Lord-Seekers are on the same rank as Lord-Warrior, and as such they are also considered nobility, but as such its below every other noble rank except the title of Lady. This is of course given to the leader of the seekers of Etchfield.</p>

        <h3 style = "text-align: center">Lady</h3><p>A lady is the title given to females of a noble family, however in the culture of Etchfield, they are considered the lowest of the noble ranks. This is likely because females do not often hold leadership roles in Etchfield, instead it falls to the males and females are considered only for use in breeding, continuing and branching a family line.</p>
